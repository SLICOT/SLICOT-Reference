SLICOT Library Subdirectory examples
------------------------------------

SLICOT Library Subdirectory examples contains all source files for
the Fortran 90/95 example programs calling the SLICOT Library routines,
the associated data files (files *.dat), and reference results
(files *.res).  The Fortran files differ from those in the subdirectory
examples77 in having references to the INTRINSIC functions MAX and MIN
in PARAMETER statements, not allowed in Fortran 77.  The reference results
have been computed on a Sun Ultra 2 machine, for the Unix distribution,
and on an Intel Pentium 3 machine, for the Windows distribution.

When installing the SLICOT software (as described in the Installation.txt
file from the SLICOT root directory), the executable Fortran example
programs are automatically created and executed, and their results
are stored in the files *.exa (with the same name as for the files with
data and reference results, and extension exa).  More details for
executing other tasks, e.g., cleaning the subdirectory examples,
are given in the file makefile included in this subdirectory.
