  To solve for X = op(U)'*op(U) either the stable non-negative
  definite continuous-time Lyapunov equation
                                2
     op(S)'*X + X*op(S) = -scale *op(R)'*op(R)                   (1)

  or the convergent non-negative definite discrete-time Lyapunov
  equation
                                2
     op(S)'*X*op(S) - X = -scale *op(R)'*op(R)                   (2)

  where op(K) = K or K' (i.e., the transpose of the matrix K), S is
  an N-by-N block upper triangular matrix with one-by-one or
  two-by-two blocks on the diagonal, R is an N-by-N upper triangular
  matrix, and scale is an output scale factor, set less than or
  equal to 1 to avoid overflow in X.

  In the case of equation (1) the matrix S must be stable (that
  is, all the eigenvalues of S must have negative real parts),
  and for equation (2) the matrix S must be convergent (that is,
  all the eigenvalues of S must lie inside the unit circle).

<B>Mode Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  DISCR   LOGICAL
          Specifies the type of Lyapunov equation to be solved as
          follows:
          = .TRUE. :  Equation (2), discrete-time case;
          = .FALSE.:  Equation (1), continuous-time case.

  LTRANS  LOGICAL
          Specifies the form of op(K) to be used, as follows:
          = .FALSE.:  op(K) = K    (No transpose);
          = .TRUE. :  op(K) = K**T (Transpose).

</PRE>
<B>Input/Output Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrices S and R.  N &gt;= 0.

  S       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension (LDS,N)
          The leading N-by-N upper Hessenberg part of this array
          must contain the block upper triangular matrix.
          The elements below the upper Hessenberg part of the array
          S are not referenced. The 2-by-2 blocks must only
          correspond to complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues (not
          to real eigenvalues).

  LDS     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array S.  LDS &gt;= MAX(1,N).

  R       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension (LDR,N)
          On entry, the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of this
          array must contain the upper triangular matrix R.
          On exit, the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of this
          array contains the upper triangular matrix U.
          The strict lower triangle of R is not referenced.

  LDR     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array R.  LDR &gt;= MAX(1,N).

  SCALE   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
          The scale factor, scale, set less than or equal to 1 to
          prevent the solution overflowing.

  INFO    INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit;
          &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
                value;
          = 1:  if the Lyapunov equation is (nearly) singular
                (warning indicator);
                if DISCR = .FALSE., this means that while the
                matrix S has computed eigenvalues with negative real
                parts, it is only just stable in the sense that
                small perturbations in S can make one or more of the
                eigenvalues have a non-negative real part;
                if DISCR = .TRUE., this means that while the
                matrix S has computed eigenvalues inside the unit
                circle, it is nevertheless only just convergent, in
                the sense that small perturbations in S can make one
                or more of the eigenvalues lie outside the unit
                circle;
                perturbed values were used to solve the equation
                (but the matrix S is unchanged);
          = 2:  if the matrix S is not stable (that is, one or more
                of the eigenvalues of S has a non-negative real
                part), if DISCR = .FALSE., or not convergent (that
                is, one or more of the eigenvalues of S lies outside
                the unit circle), if DISCR = .TRUE.;
          = 3:  if the matrix S has two or more consecutive non-zero
                elements on the first sub-diagonal, so that there is
                a block larger than 2-by-2 on the diagonal;
          = 4:  if the matrix S has a 2-by-2 diagonal block with
                real eigenvalues instead of a complex conjugate
                pair.

  The method used by the routine is based on a variant of the
  Bartels and Stewart backward substitution method [1], that finds
  the Cholesky factor op(U) directly without first finding X and
  without the need to form the normal matrix op(R)'*op(R) [2].

  The continuous-time Lyapunov equation in the canonical form
                                                     2
    op(S)'*op(U)'*op(U) + op(U)'*op(U)*op(S) = -scale *op(R)'*op(R),

  or the discrete-time Lyapunov equation in the canonical form
                                                     2
    op(S)'*op(U)'*op(U)*op(S) - op(U)'*op(U) = -scale *op(R)'*op(R),

  where U and R are upper triangular, is solved for U.

  The algorithm requires 0(N ) operations and is backward stable.

  The Lyapunov equation may be very ill-conditioned. In particular
  if S is only just stable (or convergent) then the Lyapunov
  equation will be ill-conditioned. "Large" elements in U relative
  to those of S and R, or a "small" value for scale, is a symptom
  of ill-conditioning. A condition estimate can be computed using
  SLICOT Library routine SB03MD.
