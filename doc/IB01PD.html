<PRE>
  To estimate the matrices A, C, B, and D of a linear time-invariant
  (LTI) state space model, using the singular value decomposition
  information provided by other routines. Optionally, the system and
  noise covariance matrices, needed for the Kalman gain, are also
  determined.

<B>Mode Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  METH    CHARACTER*1

          as follows:
          = 'M':  MOESP  algorithm with past inputs and outputs;
          = 'N':  N4SID  algorithm.

  JOB     CHARACTER*1
          Specifies which matrices should be computed, as follows:
          = 'A':  compute all system matrices, A, B, C, and D;
          = 'C':  compute the matrices A and C only;
          = 'B':  compute the matrix B only;
          = 'D':  compute the matrices B and D only.

  JOBCV   CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether or not the covariance matrices are to
          be computed, as follows:
          = 'C':  the covariance matrices should be computed;
          = 'N':  the covariance matrices should not be computed.

</PRE>
<B>Input/Output Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  NOBR    (input) INTEGER
          The number of block rows,  s,  in the input and output
          Hankel matrices processed by other routines.  NOBR &gt; 1.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the system.  NOBR &gt; N &gt; 0.

  M       (input) INTEGER
          The number of system inputs.  M &gt;= 0.

  L       (input) INTEGER
          The number of system outputs.  L &gt; 0.

  NSMPL   (input) INTEGER
          If JOBCV = 'C', the total number of samples used for
          calculating the covariance matrices.
          NSMPL &gt;= 2*(M+L)*NOBR.
          This parameter is not meaningful if  JOBCV = 'N'.

  R       (input/workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
          ( LDR,2*(M+L)*NOBR )
          On entry, the leading  2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR  part
          of this array must contain the relevant data for the MOESP
          or N4SID algorithms, as constructed by SLICOT Library
          routines IB01AD or IB01ND. Let  R_ij,  i,j = 1:4,  be the
          ij submatrix of  R  (denoted  S  in IB01AD and IB01ND),
          partitioned by  M*NOBR,  L*NOBR,  M*NOBR,  and  L*NOBR
          rows and columns. The submatrix  R_22  contains the matrix
          of left singular vectors used. Also needed, for
          METH = 'N'  or  JOBCV = 'C',  are the submatrices  R_11,
          R_14 : R_44,  and, for  METH = 'M'  and  JOB &lt;&gt; 'C',  the
          submatrices  R_31  and  R_12,  containing the processed
          matrices  R_1c  and  R_2c,  respectively, as returned by
          SLICOT Library routines IB01AD or IB01ND.
          Moreover, if  METH = 'N'  and  JOB = 'A' or 'C',  the
          block-row  R_41 : R_43  must contain the transpose of the
          block-column  R_14 : R_34  as returned by SLICOT Library
          routines IB01AD or IB01ND.
          The remaining part of  R  is used as workspace.
          On exit, part of this array is overwritten. Specifically,
          if  METH = 'M',  R_22  and  R_31  are overwritten if
              JOB = 'B' or 'D',  and  R_12,  R_22,  R_14 : R_34,

<B>Tolerances</B>
<PRE>
  TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
          The tolerance to be used for estimating the rank of
          matrices. If the user sets  TOL &gt; 0,  then the given value
          of  TOL  is used as a lower bound for the reciprocal
          condition number;  an m-by-n matrix whose estimated
          condition number is less than  1/TOL  is considered to
          be of full rank.  If the user sets  TOL &lt;= 0,  then an
          implicitly computed, default tolerance, defined by
          TOLDEF = m*n*EPS,  is used instead, where  EPS  is the
          relative machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine
          DLAMCH).

          SLICOT Library routines IB01PY or IB01PX),  respectively.
          If  METH = 'N',  DWORK(3)  is set to one without any
          calculations. Similarly, if  METH = 'M'  and  JOBCV = 'N',
          DWORK(4)  is set to one. If  M = 0  or  JOB = 'C',
          DWORK(3)  and  DWORK(5)  are set to one.
          On exit, if  INFO = -30,  DWORK(1)  returns the minimum
          value of LDWORK.

          The length of the array DWORK.
          LDWORK &gt;= max( LDW1,LDW2 ), where, if METH = 'M',

  IWARN   INTEGER

<A name="Method"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Method</FONT></B></A>
<PRE>
  In the MOESP approach, the matrices  A  and  C  are first
  computed from an estimated extended observability matrix [1],
  and then, the matrices  B  and  D  are obtained by solving an
  extended linear system in a least squares sense.
  In the N4SID approach, besides the estimated extended
  observability matrix, the solutions of two least squares problems
  are used to build another least squares problem, whose solution
  is needed to compute the system matrices  A,  C,  B,  and  D.  The
  solutions of the two least squares problems are also optionally
  used by both approaches to find the covariance matrices.

  In some applications, it is useful to compute the system matrices
  using two calls to this routine, the first one with  JOB = 'C',
  and the second one with  JOB = 'B' or 'D'.  This is slightly less
  efficient than using a single call with  JOB = 'A',  because some
  calculations are repeated. If  METH = 'N',  all the calculations
  at the first call are performed again at the second call;
  moreover, it is required to save the needed submatrices of  R
  before the first call and restore them before the second call.
  If the covariance matrices are desired,  JOBCV  should be set
  to  'C'  at the second call. If  B  and  D  are both needed, they
  should be computed at once.
  It is possible to compute the matrices A and C using the MOESP
  algorithm (METH = 'M'), and the matrices B and D using the N4SID
  algorithm (METH = 'N'). This combination could be slightly more
  efficient than N4SID algorithm alone and it could be more accurate
  than MOESP algorithm. No saving/restoring is needed in such a
  combination, provided  JOBCV  is set to  'N'  at the first call.
  Recommended usage:  either one call with  JOB = 'A',  or
     first  call with  METH = 'M',  JOB = 'C',  JOBCV = 'N',
     second call with  METH = 'M',  JOB = 'D',  JOBCV = 'C',  or
     first  call with  METH = 'M',  JOB = 'C',  JOBCV = 'N',
     second call with  METH = 'N',  JOB = 'D',  JOBCV = 'C'.
