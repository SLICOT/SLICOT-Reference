<PRE>                        H
  To solve for X = op(U) *op(U) either the stable non-negative
  definite continuous-time Lyapunov equation
          H                     2      H
     op(A) *X + X*op(A) = -scale *op(B) *op(B),                  (1)

  or the convergent non-negative definite discrete-time Lyapunov
  equation
          H                     2      H
     op(A) *X*op(A) - X = -scale *op(B) *op(B),                  (2)

  where op(K) = K or K**H  (i.e., the conjugate transpose of the
  matrix K), A is an N-by-N matrix, op(B) is an M-by-N matrix, U is
  an upper triangular matrix containing the Cholesky factor of the
  solution matrix X, and scale is an output scale factor, set less
  than or equal to 1 to avoid overflow in X. If matrix B has full
  rank, then the solution matrix X will be positive definite and
  hence the Cholesky factor U will be nonsingular, but if B is rank
  deficient, then X may be only positive semi-definite and U will be
  singular.

  In the case of equation (1) the matrix A must be stable (that is,
  all the eigenvalues of A must have negative real parts), and for
  equation (2) the matrix A must be convergent (that is, all the
  eigenvalues of A must lie inside the unit circle).

<B>Mode Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  DICO    CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the type of Lyapunov equation to be solved, as
          follows:
          = 'C':  Equation (1), continuous-time case;
          = 'D':  Equation (2), discrete-time case.

  FACT    CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether or not the Schur factorization of the
          matrix A is supplied on entry, as follows:
          = 'F':  On entry, A and Q contain the factors from the
                  Schur factorization of the matrix A;
          = 'N':  The Schur factorization of A will be computed
                  and the factors will be stored in A and Q.

          Specifies the form of op(K) to be used, as follows:
          = 'N':  op(K) = K    (No transpose);

</PRE>

          If M = 0, A is unchanged on exit, and Q and W are not set.

  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the leading N-by-N part of this array must
          contain the matrix A. If FACT = 'F', then A contains
          an upper triangular matrix S in Schur form; the elements
          below the diagonal of the array A are then not referenced.
          On exit, the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of this
          array contains the upper triangle of the matrix S.
          The contents of the array A is not modified if FACT = 'F'.

  LDA     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= MAX(1,N).

  Q       (input or output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDQ,N)
          On entry, if FACT = 'F', then the leading N-by-N part of
          this array must contain the unitary matrix Q of the Schur
          factorization of A.
          Otherwise, Q need not be set on entry.
          On exit, the leading N-by-N part of this array contains
          the unitary matrix Q of the Schur factorization of A.
          The contents of the array Q is not modified if FACT = 'F'.

          if TRANS = 'N', and dimension (LDB,max(M,N)), if
          TRANS = 'C'.
          On entry, if TRANS = 'N', the leading M-by-N part of this
          array must contain the coefficient matrix B of the
          equation.
          On entry, if TRANS = 'C', the leading N-by-M part of this
          array must contain the coefficient matrix B of the
          equation.
          On exit, the leading N-by-N part of this array contains
          the upper triangular Cholesky factor U of the solution
          matrix X of the problem, X = op(U)**H * op(U).
          If M = 0 and N &gt; 0, then U is set to zero.

          The scale factor, scale, set less than or equal to 1 to
          prevent the solution overflowing.

  W       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
          If INFO &gt;= 0 and INFO &lt;= 3, W contains the eigenvalues of
          the matrix A.

</PRE>
<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)

  ZWORK   COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LZWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 0 or INFO = 1, ZWORK(1) returns the
          optimal value of LZWORK.
          On exit, if INFO = -16, ZWORK(1) returns the minimum value
          of LZWORK.

  LZWORK  INTEGER
          The length of the array ZWORK.
          If M &gt; 0, LZWORK &gt;= MAX(1,2*N+MAX(MIN(N,M)-2,0));
          If M = 0, LZWORK &gt;= 1.
          For optimum performance LZWORK should sometimes be larger.

          If LZWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal size of the ZWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the ZWORK
          array, and no error message related to LZWORK is issued by
          XERBLA.

<B>Error Indicator</B>
<PRE>
  INFO    INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit;
          &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
                value;

                (warning indicator);
                if DICO = 'C' this means that while the matrix A
                (or the factor S) has computed eigenvalues with
                negative real parts, it is only just stable in the
                sense that small perturbations in A can make one or
                more of the eigenvalues have a non-negative real
                part;
                if DICO = 'D' this means that while the matrix A
                (or the factor S) has computed eigenvalues inside
                the unit circle, it is nevertheless only just
                convergent, in the sense that small perturbations
                in A can make one or more of the eigenvalues lie
                outside the unit circle;
                perturbed values were used to solve the equation;
          = 2:  if FACT = 'N' and DICO = 'C', but the matrix A is
                not stable (that is, one or more of the eigenvalues
                of A has a non-negative real part), or DICO = 'D',
                but the matrix A is not convergent (that is, one or
                more of the eigenvalues of A lies outside the unit
                circle); however, A will still have been factored
                and the eigenvalues of A returned in W;
          = 3:  if FACT = 'F' and DICO = 'C', but the Schur factor S
                supplied in the array A is not stable (that is, one
                or more of the eigenvalues of S has a non-negative
                real part), or DICO = 'D', but the Schur factor S
                supplied in the array A is not convergent (that is,
                one or more of the eigenvalues of S lies outside the
                unit circle); the eigenvalues of A are still
                returned in W;
          = 6:  if FACT = 'N' and the LAPACK Library routine ZGEES
                has failed to converge. This failure is not likely
                to occur. The matrix B will be unaltered but A will
                be destroyed.

<PRE>
  The method used by the routine is based on the Bartels and Stewart
  method [1], except that it finds the upper triangular matrix U
  directly without first finding X and without the need to form the
  normal matrix op(B)**H * op(B).

  The Schur factorization of a square matrix A is given by
            H
     A = QSQ ,

  where Q is unitary and S is an N-by-N upper triangular matrix.
  If A has already been factored prior to calling the routine, then
  the factors Q and S may be supplied and the initial factorization
  omitted.

  If TRANS = 'N' and 6*M &gt; 7*N, the matrix B is factored as
  (QR factorization)
         _   _
     B = P ( R ), 
           ( 0 )
        _                                 _
  where P is an M-by-M unitary matrix and R is a square upper
                                      _   _
  triangular matrix. Then, the matrix B = RQ is factored as
     _
     B = PR.

  If TRANS = 'N' and 6*M &lt;= 7*N, the matrix BQ is factored as

     BQ = P ( R ),   M &gt;= N,   BQ = P ( R  Z ),   M &lt; N.
            ( 0 ) 

  If TRANS = 'C' and 6*M &gt; 7*N, the matrix B is factored as
  (RQ factorization)
              _   _
     B = ( 0  R ) P,
        _                                 _
  where P is an M-by-M unitary matrix and R is a square upper
                                      _    H _
  triangular matrix. Then, the matrix B = Q  R is factored as
     _
     B = RP.
                                             H
  If TRANS = 'C' and 6*M &lt;= 7*N, the matrix Q  B is factored as

      H                              H     ( Z )
     Q  B = ( 0  R ) P,   M &gt;= N,   Q  B = (   ) P,   M &lt; N.
                                           ( R )

  These factorizations are utilised to either transform the
  continuous-time Lyapunov equation to the canonical form
         H      H              H                     2      H
    op(S) *op(V) *op(V) + op(V) *op(V)*op(S) = -scale *op(F) *op(F),

  or the discrete-time Lyapunov equation to the canonical form
         H      H                    H               2      H
    op(S) *op(V) *op(V)*op(S) - op(V) *op(V) = -scale *op(F) *op(F),

  where V and F are upper triangular, and

     F = R,  M &gt;= N,   F = ( R  Z ),  M &lt; N,  if TRANS = 'N';
                           ( 0  0 )

     F = R,  M &gt;= N,   F = ( 0  Z ),  M &lt; N,  if TRANS = 'C'.
                           ( 0  R )

  The transformed equation is then solved for V, from which U is
  obtained via the QR factorization of V*Q**H, if TRANS = 'N', or
  via the RQ factorization of Q*V, if TRANS = 'C'.

  The Lyapunov equation may be very ill-conditioned. In particular,
  if A is only just stable (or convergent) then the Lyapunov
  equation will be ill-conditioned.  A symptom of ill-conditioning
  is "large" elements in U relative to those of A and B, or a
  "small" value for scale.

  SB03OZ routine can be also used for solving "unstable" Lyapunov
  equations, i.e., when matrix A has all eigenvalues with positive
  real parts, if DICO = 'C', or with moduli greater than one,
  if DICO = 'D'. Specifically, one may solve for X = op(U)**H*op(U)
  either the continuous-time Lyapunov equation
          H                    2      H
     op(A) *X + X*op(A) = scale *op(B) *op(B),                   (3)

  or the discrete-time Lyapunov equation
          H                    2      H
     op(A) *X*op(A) - X = scale *op(B) *op(B),                   (4)

  provided, for equation (3), the given matrix A is replaced by -A,
  or, for equation (4), the given matrices A and B are replaced by
  inv(A) and B*inv(A), if TRANS = 'N' (or inv(A)*B, if TRANS = 'C'),
  respectively. Although the inversion generally can rise numerical
  problems, in case of equation (4) it is expected that the matrix A
  is enough well-conditioned, having only eigenvalues with moduli
  greater than 1.
