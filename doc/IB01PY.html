<PRE>
  1. To compute the triangular  (QR)  factor of the  p-by-L*s
  structured matrix  Q,

      [ Q_1s  Q_1,s-1  Q_1,s-2  ...  Q_12  Q_11 ]
      [  0      Q_1s   Q_1,s-1  ...  Q_13  Q_12 ]
  Q = [  0       0       Q_1s   ...  Q_14  Q_13 ],
      [  :       :        :           :     :   ]
      [  0       0        0     ...   0    Q_1s ]

  and apply the transformations to the p-by-m matrix  Kexpand,

            [ K_1 ]
            [ K_2 ]
  Kexpand = [ K_3 ],
            [  :  ]
            [ K_s ]

  where, for MOESP approach (METH = 'M'), p = s*(L*s-n), and
  Q_1i = u2(L*(i-1)+1:L*i,:)'  is  (Ls-n)-by-L,  for  i = 1:s,
  u2 = Un(1:L*s,n+1:L*s),  K_i = K(:,(i-1)*m+1:i*m)  (i = 1:s)
  is  (Ls-n)-by-m, and for N4SID approach (METH = 'N'), p = s*(n+L),
  and

            [   -L_1|1    ]          [ M_i-1 - L_1|i ]
     Q_11 = [             ],  Q_1i = [               ],  i = 2:s,
            [ I_L - L_2|1 ]          [     -L_2|i    ]

  are  (n+L)-by-L  matrices, and
  K_i = K(:,(i-1)*m+1:i*m),  i = 1:s,  is  (n+L)-by-m.
  The given matrices are:
  For  METH = 'M',  u2 = Un(1:L*s,n+1:L*s),
                    K(1:Ls-n,1:m*s);

                        [ L_1|1  ...  L_1|s ]
  For  METH = 'N',  L = [                   ],   (n+L)-by-L*s,
                        [ L_2|1  ...  L_2|s ]

                    M = [ M_1  ...  M_s-1 ],  n-by-L*(s-1),  and
                    K,                        (n+L)-by-m*s.
                    Matrix M is the pseudoinverse of the matrix GaL,
                    built from the first  n  relevant singular
                    vectors,  GaL = Un(1:L(s-1),1:n),  and computed
                    by SLICOT Library routine IB01PD for METH = 'N'.

  Matrix  Q  is triangularized  (in  R),  exploiting its structure,
  and the transformations are applied from the left to  Kexpand.

  2. To estimate the matrices B and D of a linear time-invariant
  (LTI) state space model, using the factor  R,  transformed matrix
  Kexpand, and the singular value decomposition information provided
  by other routines.

  IB01PY  routine is intended for speed and efficient use of the
  memory space. It is generally not recommended for  METH = 'N',  as
  IB01PX  routine can produce more accurate results.

</PRE>
<B>Tolerances</B>
<PRE>
  TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
          The tolerance to be used for estimating the rank of
          matrices. If the user sets  TOL &gt; 0,  then the given value
          of  TOL  is used as a lower bound for the reciprocal
          condition number;  an m-by-n matrix whose estimated
          condition number is less than  1/TOL  is considered to
          be of full rank.  If the user sets  TOL &lt;= 0,  then an
          implicitly computed, default tolerance, defined by
          TOLDEF = m*n*EPS,  is used instead, where  EPS  is the
          relative machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine
          DLAMCH).
          This parameter is not used if  M = 0  or  JOB = 'N'.

</PRE>
<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension ( LIWORK )

                 LIWORK &gt;= L*NOBR,  if  JOB &lt;&gt; 'N',  and  M &gt; 0.

  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( LDWORK )
          On exit, if  INFO = 0,  DWORK(1) returns the optimal value
          of  LDWORK,  and, if  JOB &lt;&gt; 'N',  and  M &gt; 0,  DWORK(2)
          contains the reciprocal condition number of the triangular
          factor of the matrix  R.
          On exit, if  INFO = -28,  DWORK(1)  returns the minimum
          value of LDWORK.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          The length of the array DWORK.
          LDWORK &gt;= MAX( 2*L, L*NOBR, L+M*NOBR ),
                                      if  JOB = 'N',  or  M = 0;
          LDWORK &gt;= MAX( L+M*NOBR, L*NOBR + MAX( 3*L*NOBR+1, M ) ),
                                      if  JOB &lt;&gt; 'N',  and  M &gt; 0.
          For good performance,  LDWORK  should be larger.

</PRE>
<B>Warning Indicator</B>
<PRE>
  IWARN   INTEGER
          = 0:  no warning;
          = 4:  the least squares problem to be solved has a
                rank-deficient coefficient matrix.

</PRE>
<B>Error Indicator</B>
<PRE>
  INFO    INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit;
          &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
                value;
          = 3:  a singular upper triangular matrix was found.

<PRE>
  The computed matrices B and D are not the least squares solutions
  delivered by either MOESP or N4SID algorithms, except for the
  special case n = s - 1, L = 1. However, the computed B and D are
  frequently good enough estimates, especially for  METH = 'M'.
  Better estimates could be obtained by calling SLICOT Library
  routine IB01PX, but it is less efficient, and requires much more
  workspace.
