<PRE>
  To perform the minimization of the maximum of a set of smooth
  objective functions (possibly a single one or none at all) subject
  to nonlinear equality and inequality constraints, linear equality
  and inequality constraints, and simple bounds on the variables.
  Specifically, the problem to solve is of the form

                           min max{f (x)}
                                i   i

  where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= NF, and x is a vector in R  subject to the
  following constraints

   bl &lt;= x &lt;= bu

   g (x)&lt;=0,    j = 1 ... NINEQN
    j
   g (x)&lt;=0,    j = NINEQN+1 ... NINEQ
    j
   h (x)=0,     j = 1 ... NEQN

<B>Mode Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  MODE    (input) INTEGER
          mode = CBA (a 3-digit number) with the following meaning
          (see [1] for more details):

          A specifies the problem to be solved:
          A = 0: The problem is that described above.
          A = 1: In the problem described above, the function to
                 minimize is replaced by
                           min max{ABS(f (x))}
                                i       i
                 i.e., absolute values of the objective functions
                 are taken.

          B indicates the method to be used:
          B = 0: Algorithm FFSQP-AL is selected (see METHOD below).
          B = 1: Algorithm FFSQP-NL is selected (see METHOD below).

          C indicates the order of evaluation of objective
          functions and constraints during the line search:
          C = 1: The function that caused the previous value of t
                 to be rejected is checked first and all functions
                 of the same type ("objective" or "constraint") as
                 the latter will then be checked first (recommended
                 for most users).
          C = 2: Constraints will be always checked first at each
                 trial point during the line search. If it is a
                 contraint that caused the previous value of t to
                 be rejected, that constraint will be checked first
                 (useful when objective functions are not defined or
                 are difficult to evaluate outside of the feasible
                 region).

  IPRINT  (input) INTEGER
          Parameter indicating the desired output (see [1] for a
          more complete description of the output).
          IPRINT = 0: No information except for user-input errors
             is displayed. This value is imposed during phase 1.
          IPRINT = 1: Objective and constraint values at the
             initial feasible point are displayed. At the end of
             execution, status (INFO), iterate, objective values,
             constraint values, number of evaluations of objectives
             and nonlinear constraints, norm of the Kuhn-Tucker
             vector, and sum of feasibility violation are
             displayed.
          IPRINT = 2: At the end of each iteration, the same
             information as with IPRINT = 1 is displayed.
          IPRINT = 3: At each iteration, the same information as
             with IPRINT = 2,including detailed information on the
             search direction computation, on the line search, and
             on the update, is displayed.
          IPRINT = 10*N +M: N any positive integer, M=2 or 3.
             Information corresponding to IPRINT=M is displayed at
             every (10*N)th iteration and at the last iteration.

<B>User-supplied Subroutines</B>
<PRE>
  OBJ     SUBROUTINE
          Computes the value of the objective functions. If NF = 0,
          a (dummy) subroutine must be provided anyway. The 
          specification of OBJ is

          SUBROUTINE OBJ(NPARAM,J,X,FJ)
          INTEGER NPARAM, J
          DOUBLE PRECISION X(NPARAM),FJ

          Arguments:
          NPARAM (Input) Dimension of X.
          J (Input) Number of the objective to be computed.
          X (Input) Current iterate.
          FJ (Output) Value of the jth objective function at X.

  CONSTR  SUBROUTINE
          Computes the value of the constraints. If there are no
          constraints, a (dummy) subroutine must be provided anyway.
          The specification of CONSTR is as follows.

          SUBROUTINE CONSTR(NPARAM,J,X,GJ)
          INTEGER NPARAM,J
          DOUBLE PRECISION X(NPARAM),GJ

          Arguments:
          NPARAM (Input) Dimension of X.
          J (Input) Number of the constraint to be computed.
          X (Input) Current iterate.
          GJ (Output) Value of the jth constraint at X.

          The order of the constraints must be as follows. First
          the NINEQN (possibly zero) nonlinear inequality
          constraints. Then the NINEQ-NINEQN (possibly zero) linear
          inequality constraints. Finally, the NEQN (possibly zero)
          nonlinear equality constraints followed by the NEQ-NEQN
          (possibly zero) linear equality constraints.

  GRADOB  SUBROUTINE
          Computes the gradients of the objective functions. The
          user must pass the subroutine name GROBFD, if he/she
          wishes that FSQP evaluate these gradients automatically,
          by forward finite differences. The specification of GRADOB
          is as follows.

          SUBROUTINE GRADOB(NPARAM,J,X,GRADFJ,DUMMY)
          INTEGER NPARAM,J
          DOUBLE PRECISION X(NPARAM),GRADFJ(NPARAM)
          DOUBLE PRECISION DUMMY
          EXTERNAL DUMMY

          Arguments:
          NPARAM (Input) Dimension of X.
          J (Input) Number of objective for which gradient is to be
                computed.
          X (Input) Current iterate.
          GRADFJ (Output) Gradient of the jth objective function at
                X.
          DUMMY (Input) Used by GROBFD (internally assigned the 
                name of the objective function subroutine by FFSQP).

          Note that DUMMY is passed as argument to GRADOB to allow
          for forward finite difference computation of the gradient.

  GRADCN  SUBROUTINE
          Computes the gradients of the constraints. The
          user must pass the subroutine name GRCNFD, if he/she
          wishes that FSQP evaluate these gradients automatically,
          by forward finite differences. The specification of GRADCN
          is as follows

          SUBROUTINE GRADCN (NPARAM,J,X,GRADGJ,DUMMY)
          INTEGER NPARAM,J
          DOUBLE PRECISION X(NPARAM),GRADGJ(NPARAM)
          DOUBLE PRECISION DUMMY
          EXTERNAL DUMMY

          Arguments:
          NPARAM (Input) Dimension of X.
          J (Input) Number of constraint for which gradient is to
                be computed.
          X (Input) Current iterate.
          GRADGJ (Output) Gradient of the jth constraint evaluated
                at X.
          DUMMY (Input) Used by GRCNFD (internally assigned the
                name of the constraint function subroutine by
                FFSQP).

          Note that DUMMY is passed as argument to GRADCN to allow
          for forward finite difference computation of the gradients.

          Number (possibly zero) of nonlinear inequality 
          constraints.

  UDELTA  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
          The perturbation size the user suggests to use in

          choose it. See [1] for details.

  BIGBND  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
          It plays the role of Infinite Bound (see also BL and BU
          below). 

  BL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NPARAM)
          Lower bounds for the components of X. To specify a non-
          existent lower bound for some j, the value used must
          satisfy BL(j) &lt;= -BIGBND.

  BU      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NPARAM)
          Upper bounds for the components of X. To specify a non-
          existent upper bound for some j, the value used must

  X       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NPARAM)
          On entry, this is the initial guess.

</PRE>
<B>Tolerances</B>
<PRE>
  TOL1    DOUBLE PRECISION
          Corresponds to argument EPS in [1].
          Final norm requirement for the Newton direction (see [1],
          argument EPS). It must be bigger than the machine 
          precision epsmac (computed by FSQP). If the user does
          not have a good feeling of what value should be chosen,
          a very small number could be provided and IPRINT = 2 be
          selected so that the user would be able to keep track of
          the process of optimization and terminate FSQP at
          appropriate time.

  TOL2    DOUBLE PRECISION
          Corresponds to argument EPSEQN in [1].
          Maximum violation of nonlinear equality constraints
          allowed by the user at an optimal point. It is in effect
          only if NEQN &gt; 0 and must be bigger than the machine
          precision epsmac (computed by FSQP).

</PRE>
<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (LIWORK)
          Corresponds to argument IW in [1].

  LIWORK  INTEGER
          Corresponds to argument IWSIZE in [1].
          The length of array IWORK. It must be at least as big as 
          6*NPARAM + 8*max(1,NINEQ+NEQ) + 7*max(1,NF) + 30. This
          estimate is usually very conservative and the smallest
          suitable value will be displayed if the user-supplied
          value is too small.

  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
          Corresponds to argument W in [1].
          On exit, it will contain estimates of Lagrange
          multipliers at the end of execution. These multipliers
          will be placed in the first NPARAM + NINEQ + NEQ + NFF
          entries; where NFF = 0 if (in mode) A = 0 and NF = 1, and
          NFF = NF otherwise. See [1] for details.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          Corresponds to argument NWSIZE in [1].
          The length of array DWORK. It must be at least as big as
          4*SQR(NPARAM) + 5*MAX(1,NINEQ+NEQ)*NPARAM + 
          3*MAX(1,NF)*NPARAM + 26*(NPARAM+MAX(1,NF)) + 
          45*MAX(1,NINEQ+NEQ) + 100.
          This estimate is usually very conservative and the 
          smallest suitable value will be displayed if the user-
          supplied value is too small.

</PRE>
<B>Error Indicator</B>
<PRE>
  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          Corresponds to argument INFORM in [1].
          INFO = 0: Normal termination of execution.
          INFO = 1: The user-provided initial guess is infeasible
             for linear constraints and FFSQP is unable to generate
             a point satisfying all these constraints.
          INFO = 2: The user-provided initial guess is infeasible
             for nonlinear inequality constraints and linear
             constraints; and FFSQP is unable to generate a point
             satisfying all these constraints.
          INFO = 3: The maximum number miter of iterations has
             been reached before a solution is obtained.
          INFO = 4: The line search fails to find a new iterate
             (trial step size being smaller than the machine
             precision epsmac computed by FFSQP).
          INFO = 5: Failure of the QP solver in attempting to
             construct d0. A more robust QP solver may succeed.
          INFO = 6: Failure of the QP solver in attempting to
             construct d1 . A more robust QP solver may succeed.
          INFO = 7: Input data are not consistent (with printout
             indicating the error).
          INFO = 8: Two consecutive iterates are numerically
             equivalent before a stopping criterion is satisfied.
          INFO = 9: One of the penalty parameters exceeded
             BIGBND. The algorithm is having trouble satisfying a
             nonlinear equality constraint.

</PRE>
<A name="Method"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Method</FONT></B></A>
<PRE>
  If the initial guess provided by the user is infeasible for
  nonlinear inequality constraints and linear constraints, FFSQP
  first generates a point satisfying all these constraints by
  iterating on the problem of minimizing the maximum of these
  constraints.

  Then, using Mayne-Polak's scheme, nonlinear equality
  constraints are turned into nonlinear inequality constraints
  and the original objective function is replaced by a modified
  objective function.

  After obtaining feasibility, either (i) an Armijo-type line
  search may be used (algorithm FFSQP-AL), yielding a monotone
  decrease of the objective function at each iteration; or (ii) a
  nonmonotone line search may be selected (algorithm FFSQP-NL),
  forcing a decrease of the objective function within at most four
  iterations.
