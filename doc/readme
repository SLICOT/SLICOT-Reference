SLICOT Library Subdirectory doc
-------------------------------

SLICOT Library Subdirectory doc contains documentation files (*.html) for almost
all SLICOT Library routines.  Omitted are few auxiliary routines, called by
other SLICOT routines, but which seem to have no general use.  The documentation
conforms to the SLICOT standards.  Besides function, arguments, and algorithm
description, most documents for user-callable rotines include example programs,
which could be easily modified, by copying, pasting, etc., to solve related,
specific problems.

The documentation files could be viewed individually, or via the provided index
files: the main SLICOT Library index (libindex.html), stored in the SLICOT root
directory, or the auxiliary, supporting routines index (support.html), stored in
the subdirectory doc.  The second file is also accessible from the first one.
These index files are organized according to the SLICOT Library chapters, sections,
and subsections.
