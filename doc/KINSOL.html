<PRE>
  GSTRAT  (input) INTEGER
          Indicates the global strategy to apply the computed
          increment delta in the solution UU.  Choices are:
          0 - Inexact Newton.
          1 - Linesearch.

  LINSU   SUBROUTINE
          Linear Solver Set-up Routine. This is the KINSOL routine
          to be called to set-up the linear solver. The user should
          specify here one of the 6 different Fortran-callable
          routines provided by KINSOL for this purpose. The choice
          to be used depends on which of the optional user-defined
          routines are provided by the user (see User-defined
          routines below).
          LINSU can be one of the following routines: FKINSPGMR00,
          FKINSPGMR01, FKINSPGMR10, FKINSPGMR11, FKINSPGMR20, and
          FKINSPGMR21, where the first digit in the name of the
          function is: 0 if neither KPSOL nor KPRECO routines are
          provided; 1 if only the preconditioner solve routine
          (KPSOL) is provided; and 2 if both the preconditioner
          solve (KPSOL) and setup (KPRECO) routines are provided.
          The second digit is: 0 if a function FATIMES is not
          provided; and 1 if a function FATIMES is provided.

  NEQ     (input) INTEGER
          Number of equations (and unknowns) in the algebraic
          system.

  OPTIN   (input) LOGICAL
          Flag indicating whether optional inputs from the user in
          the arrays IOPT and ROPT are to be used.
          Pass FALSE to ignore all optional inputs and TRUE to use
          all optional inputs that are present. Either choice does
          NOT affect outputs in other positions of IOPT or ROPT.

  MAXL    (input) INTEGER
          Maximum Krylov dimension for the Linear Solver. Pass 0
          to use the default value MIN(Neq, 10). 

  MAXLRST (input) INTEGER
          Maximum number of linear solver restarts allowed. Values
          outside the range 0 to 2*NEQ/MAXL will be restricted to
          that range. 0, meaning no restarts, is a safe starting
          value.

  MSBPRE  (input) INTEGER
          Maximum number of steps calling the solver KPSOL
          without calling the preconditioner KPRECO. (The default is
          10).

  UU      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NEQ)
          On entry, UU is the initial guess.
          On exit, if no errors ocurr, UU is the solution of
          the system KFUN(UU) = 0.

  USCALE  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NEQ)
          Array of diagonal elements of the scaling matrix for UU.
          The elements of USCALE must be positive values. The
          scaling matrix USCALE should be chosen so that 
          USCALE * UU (as a matrix multiplication) should have all
          its components with roughly the same magnitude when UU is
          close to a root of KFUN.

  FSCALE  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NEQ)
          Array of diagonal elements of the scaling matrix for
          KFUN. The elements of FSCALE must be positive values.
          The scaling matrix FSCALE should be chosen so that
          FSCALE * KFUN(UU) (as a matrix multiplication) should
          have all its components with roughly the same magnitude
          when UU is NOT too near a root of KFUN.

  CONSTR  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NEQ)
          Constraints on UU.
          A positive value in CONSTR(I) implies that the Ith
          component of UU is to be constrained &gt; 0.
          A negative value in CONSTR(I) implies that the Ith
          component of UU is to be constrained &lt; 0.
          A zero value in CONSTR(I) implies there is no constraint
          on UU(I). 

  IOPT    (input/output) INTEGER array, dimension (40)
          Array of optional integer inputs and outputs.
          If OPTIN is TRUE, the user should preset to 0 those
          locations for which default values are to be used.
          See Optional Inputs and Outputs, below. 

  ROPT    (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (40)
          Array of optional double precision inputs and outputs.
          If OPTIN is TRUE, the user should preset to 0 those
          locations for which default values are to be used.
          See Optional Inputs and Outputs, below. 

</PRE>
<B>Tolerances</B>
<PRE>
  TOL1    DOUBLE PRECISION
          Stopping tolerance on maxnorm( FSCALE * KFUN(UU) ).
          If TOL1 is input as 0., then a default value of
          (uround) to the 1/3 power will be used. uround is the
          unit roundoff for the machine in use for the calculation.

  TOL2    DOUBLE PRECISION
          Stopping tolerance on the maximum scaled step 
          UU(K) - UU(K-1). 
          If TOL2 is input as 0., then a default value of (uround)
          to the 2/3 power will be used. uround is the unit 
          roundoff for the machine in use for the calculation.

<B>Error Indicator</B>
<PRE>
  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          See Termination Codes below.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  Termination Codes

  (Note: in this documentation we use named constants for 
  certain integer constant values. To see the values of these
  symbols see Named constants below.)

  The termination values KINS_***** are now given. These are the
  values of the INFO argument.

  SUCCESS :    means maxnorm(FSCALE*KFUN(UU) &lt;= TOL1, where
               maxnorm() is the maximum norm function N_VMaxNorm.
               Therefore, UU is probably an approximate root of
               KFUN.

  INITIAL_GUESS_OK: means the initial guess UU has been found
               to already satisfy the system to the desired
               accuracy. No calculation was performed other
               than testing UU.

  STEP_LT_STPTOL:  means the scaled distance between the last
               two steps is less than TOL2.  UU may be an
               approximate root of KFUN, but it is also possible
               that the algorithm is making very slow progress
               and is not near a root or that TOL2 is too
               large

  LNSRCH_NONCONV: means the LineSearch module failed to reduce
               norm(KFUN) sufficiently on the last global step.
               Either UU is close to a root of F and no more
               accuracy is possible, or the finite-difference
               approximation to J*v is inaccurate, or TOL2
               is too large. Check the outputs NCFL and NNI: if
               NCFL is close to NNI, it may be the case that the
               Krylov iteration is converging very slowly. In
               this case, the user may want to use precondition-
               ing and/or increase the MAXL argument (that is,
               increase the max dimension of the Krylov subspace)
               by setting MAXL to nonzero (thus not using the
               default value of KINSPGMR_MAXL) or if MAXL is being
               set, increase its value.

  MAXITER_REACHED: means that the maximum allowable number of
               nonlinear iterations has been reached. This is by
               default 200, but may be changed through optional
               input IOPT(MXITER).

  MXNEWT_5X_EXCEEDED: means 5 consecutive steps of length mxnewt
               (maximum Newton stepsize limit) have been taken.
               Either norm(F) asymptotes from above to a finite
               value in some direction, or mxnewt is too small.
               Mxnewt is computed internally (by default) as
               mxnewt = 1000*max(norm(USCALE*UU0),1), where
               UU0 is the initial guess for UU, and norm() is
               the Euclidean norm. Mxnewt can be  set by the
               user through optional input ROPT(MXNEWTSTEP).

  LINESEARCH_BCFAIL: means that more than the allowed maximum
               number of failures (MXNBCF) occurred when trying
               to satisfy the beta condition in the linesearch
               algorithm. It is likely that the iteration is
               making poor progress.

  KRYLOV_FAILURE: means there was a failure of the Krylov
               iteration process to converge.

  PRECONDSET_FAILURE: means there was a nonrecoverable
               error in PrecondSet causing the iteration to halt.

  PRECONDSOLVE_FAILURE: means there was a nonrecoverable
            error in PrecondSolve causing the iteration to halt.

  NO_MEM:    the KINSol memory pointer received was NULL.

  INPUT_ERROR: one or more input parameters or arrays was in
               error. See the program output for further info.

  LSOLV_NO_MEM: The linear solver memory pointer (lmem) was
             received as NULL. The return value from the linear
             solver needs to be checked and the cause found.

<B>Optional inputs and outputs</B>
<PRE>
  (Note: in this documentation we use named constants for 
  certain integer constant values. To see the values of these
  symbols see Named constants below.)

  The user should declare two arrays for optional input and
  output, an IOPT array for optional integer input and output
  and an ROPT array for optional real input and output. These
  arrays should both be of size OPT_SIZE.
  So the user's declaration should look like:

  INTEGER          IOPT(OPT_SIZE)
  DOUBLE PRECISION ROPT(OPT_SIZE)

  The following definitions are indices into the IOPT and ROPT
  arrays. A brief description of the contents of these positions
  follows.

  IOPT(PRINTFL)  (input)  Allows user to select from 4 levels
                 of output.
                 =0 no statistics printed   (DEFAULT)
                 =1 output the nonlinear iteration count, the
                    scaled norm of KFUN(UU), and number of
                    KFUN calls.
                 =2 same as 1 with the addition of global
                    strategy statistics:
                    f1 = 0.5*norm(FSCALE*KFUN(UU))**2   and
                    f1new = 0.5*norm(FSCALE*KFUN(unew))**2 .
                 =3 same as 2 with the addition of further
                    Krylov iteration statistics.

  IOPT(MXITER)   (input) Maximum allowable number of nonlinear
                  iterations. The default is MXITER_DEFAULT.

  IOPT(PRECOND_NO_INIT) (input) Set to 1 to prevent the initial
                   call to the routine KPRECO upon a given
                   call to KINSol. Set to 0 or leave unset to
                   force the initial call to KPRECO.
                   Use the choice of 1 only after beginning the
                   first of a series of calls with a 0 value.
                   If a value other than 0 or 1 is encountered,
                   the default, 0, is set in this element of
                   IOPT and thus the routine KPRECO will
                   be called upon every call to KINSol, unless
                   IOPT(PRECOND_NO_INIT) is changed by the user.

  IOPT(ETACHOICE) (input) A flag indicating which of three
                   methods to use for computing eta, the
                   coefficient in the linear solver
                   convergence tolerance eps, given by
                     eps = (eta+u_round)*norm(KFUN(UU)).
                   Here, all norms are  the scaled L2 norm.
                   The linear solver attempts to produce a step
                   p such that norm(KFUN(UU)+J(UU)*p) &lt;= eps.
                   Two of the methods for computing eta
                   calculate a value based on the convergence
                   process in the routine KINForcingTerm.
                   The third method does not require
                   calculation; a constant eta is selected.

                   The default if IOPT(ETACHOICE) is  not
                   specified is ETACHOICE1, (see below).

                   The allowed values (methods)  are:
              ETACONSTANT  constant eta, default of 0.1 or user
                 supplied choice, for which see ROPT(ETACONST),

              ETACHOICE1 (default) which uses choice 1 of
                 Eisenstat and Walker's paper of SIAM J. Sci.
                 Comput.,17 (1996), pp 16-32 wherein eta is:
                         eta(k) =
  ABS( norm(KFUN(UU(k))) - norm(KFUN(UU(k-1))+J(UU(k-1))*p) )
                      / norm(KFUN(UU(k-1))),

              ETACHOICE2   which uses choice 2 of
                 Eisenstat and Walker wherein eta is:
                 eta(k) = egamma *
             ( norm(KFUN(UU(k))) / norm(KFUN(u(k-1))) )^ealpha

                 egamma and ealpha for choice 2, both required,
                 are from either defaults (egamma = 0.9 ,
                 ealpha = 2)  or from  user input,
                 see ROPT(ETAALPHA) and ROPT(ETAGAMMA), below.

                 For eta(k) determined by either Choice 1 or
                 Choice 2, a value eta_safe is determined, and
                 the safeguard   eta(k) &lt;- max(eta_safe,eta(k))
                 is applied to prevent eta(k) from becoming too
                 small too quickly.
                  For Choice 1,
                    eta_safe = eta(k-1)^((1.+sqrt(5.))/2.)
           and    for Choice 2,
                    eta_safe = egamma*eta(k-1)^ealpha.
                 (These safeguards are turned off if they drop
                 below 0.1 . Also, eta is never allowed to be
                 less than eta_min = 1.e-4).

  IOPT(NO_MIN_EPS) (input) Set to 1 or greater to remove
                 protection agains eps becoming too small.
                 This option is useful for debugging linear
                 and nonlinear solver interactions. Set to 0
                 for standard eps minimum value testing.

  IOPT(NNI)      (output) Total number of nonlinear iterations.

                  step. The default value is calculated from
                  1000*max(norm(USCALE*UU(0),norm(USCALE)).

  ROPT(RELFUNC)  (input) Relative error in computing KFUN(UU)
                  if known. Default is the machine epsilon.

  ROPT(RELU)     (input) A scalar constraint which restricts
                  the update of UU to  del(UU)/UU &lt; ROPT(RELU)
                  The default is no constraint on the relative
                  step in UU.

  ROPT(ETAGAMMA) (input) The coefficient egamma in the eta
                  computation. See routine KINForcingTerm

                  computation. See routine KINForcingTerm

                   eta, used in lieu of that computed by
                       routine KINForcingTerm
           (SEE IOPT(ETACHOICE) above for additional info).

  ROPT(FNORM)    (output) The scaled norm at a given iteration:
                  norm(FSCALE(KFUN(UU)).

  ROPT(STEPL)    (output) Last step length in the global

          The user-supplied preconditioner setup function KPRECO and
          the user-supplied preconditioner solve function KPSOL
          together must define the right preconditoner matrix P
          chosen so as to provide an easier system for the Krylov
          solver to solve. KPRECO is called to provide any matrix
          data required by the subsequent call(s) to KPSOL. The
          data is expected to be stored in variables within a
          COMMON block and the definition of those variables is up
          to the user. More specifically, the user-supplied
          preconditioner setup function KPRECO is to evaluate and
          preprocess any Jacobian-related data needed by the
          preconditioner solve function KPSOL. This might include
          forming a crude approximate Jacobian, and performing an
          LU factorization on the resulting approximation to J.
          This function will not be called in advance of every call
          to KPSOL, but instead will be called only as often as
          necessary to achieve convergence within the Newton
          iteration in KINSol.  If the KPSOL function needs no
          preparation, the KPRECO function need not be provided.

          KPRECO should not modify the contents of the arrays
          UU or FVAL as those arrays are used elsewhere in the
          iteration process.

          Each call to the KPRECO function is preceded by a call to
          the system function KFUN. Thus the KPRECO function can use
          any auxiliary data that is computed by the KFUN function
          and saved in a way accessible to KPRECO.

          The two scaling arrays, FSCALE and USCALE, and unit
          roundoff UROUND are provided to the KPRECO function for
          possible use in approximating Jacobian data, e.g. by
          difference quotients. These arrays should also not be
          altered

          Jacobian, if any.  For example, if the routine calls
          KFUN a total of W times, then the update is 
          NFE = NFE + W.

          IER
          (output) INTEGER
          Error indicator. 
          0 if successful,

          SUBROUTINE KPSOL (NEQ, UU, USCALE, FVAL, FSCALE, VTEM,
                            FTEM, UROUND, NFE, IER)

          is to solve a linear system P x = r in which the matrix
          P is the (right) preconditioner matrix P.

          On exit, holds the result x.

          FTEM
          DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NEQ)
          Temporary work array.

          UROUND
          (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
          Machine unit roundoff.

          NFE
          (input/output) INTEGER
          Number of calls to KFUN made by the package. The KPRECO
          routine should update this counter by adding on the

          solution, if any.  For example, if the routine calls
          KFUN a total of W times, then the update is

          A is the Jacobian matrix dF/du, or an approximation to
          it, and V is a given  vector.  This routine computes the
          product Z = J V.

          ARGUMENTS

          V
          (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NEQ)
          Vector to be multiplied by J
          (preconditioned and unscaled as received).

          Flag indicating whether or not the UU vector has been
          changed since the last call to this function (0 means
          FALSE, 1 TRUE).
          If this function computes and saves Jacobian data, then
          this computation can be skipped if NEW_UU = FALSE.

<PRE>
  KINSOL (Krylov Inexact Newton SOLver) is a general purpose
  solver for nonlinear systems of equations. Its most notable
  feature is that it uses Krylov Inexact Newton techniques in the
  system's approximate solution. 
  The Newton method used results in the solution of linear systems
  of the form
                          J(u)*x = b
  where J(u) is the Jacobian of F at u. The solution of these
  systems by a Krylov method requires products of the form J(u)*v,
  which are approximated by a difference quotient of the form
                       F(u+sigma*v)-F(u)
                       -----------------
                            sigma
  Thus, the Jacobian need not be formed explicitly.
