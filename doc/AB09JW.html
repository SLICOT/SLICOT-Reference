<PRE>
  To construct a state-space representation (A,BS,CS,DS) of the
  projection of G*W or G*conj(W) containing the poles of G, from the
  state-space representations (A,B,C,D) and (AW-lambda*EW,BW,CW,DW),
  of the transfer-function matrices G and W, respectively.
  G is assumed to be a stable transfer-function matrix and
  the state matrix A must be in a real Schur form.
  When computing the stable projection of G*W, it is assumed
  that G and W have completely distinct poles.
  When computing the stable projection of G*conj(W), it is assumed
  that G and conj(W) have completely distinct poles.

  Note: For a transfer-function matrix G, conj(G) denotes the
  conjugate of G given by G'(-s) for a continuous-time system or
  G'(1/z) for a discrete-time system.

  If JOB = 'W', the matrices of the stable projection of G*W are
  computed as

    BS = B*DW + Y*BW,  CS = C,  DS = D*DW,

  where Y satisfies the generalized Sylvester equation

    -A*Y*EW + Y*AW + B*CW = 0.

  If JOB = 'C', the matrices of the stable projection of G*conj(W)
  are computed using the following formulas:

  - for a continuous-time system, the matrices BS, CS and DS of
    the stable projection are computed as

      BS = B*DW' + Y*CW',  CS = C,  DS = D*DW',

    where Y satisfies the generalized Sylvester equation

      A*Y*EW' + Y*AW' + B*BW' = 0.

  - for a discrete-time system, the matrices BS, CS and DS of
    the stable projection are computed as

      BS = B*DW' + A*Y*CW',  CS = C,  DS = D*DW' + C*Y*CW',

    where Y satisfies the generalized Sylvester equation

      Y*EW' - A*Y*AW' = B*BW'.
