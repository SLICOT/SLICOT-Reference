  To compute the following matrices

             -1
      G = B*R  *B',

      -               -1
      A = A +/- op(B*R  *L'),

      -            -1
      Q = Q +/- L*R  *L',

  where A, B, Q, R, L, and G are N-by-N, N-by-M, N-by-N, M-by-M,
  N-by-M, and N-by-N matrices, respectively, with Q, R and G
  symmetric matrices, and op(W) is one of

      op(W) = W  or  op(W) = W'.

  When R is well-conditioned with respect to inversion, standard
  algorithms for solving linear-quadratic optimization problems will
  then also solve optimization problems with coupling weighting
  matrix L. Moreover, a gain in efficiency is possible using matrix
  G in the deflating subspace algorithms (see SLICOT Library routine
  SB02OD) or in the Newton's algorithms (see SLICOT Library routine
  SG02CD).

<B>Mode Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  JOBG    CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether or not the matrix G is to be computed,
          as follows:
          = 'G':  Compute G;
          = 'N':  Do not compute G.

  JOBL    CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether or not the matrix L is zero, as follows:
          = 'Z':  L is zero;
          = 'N':  L is nonzero.

  FACT    CHARACTER*1
          Specifies how the matrix R is given (factored or not), as
          follows:
          = 'N':  Array R contains the matrix R;
          = 'C':  Array R contains the Cholesky factor of R;
          = 'U':  Array R contains the factors of the symmetric
                  indefinite UdU' or LdL' factorization of R.

  UPLO    CHARACTER*1
          Specifies which triangle of the matrices R, Q (if
          JOBL = 'N'), and G (if JOBG = 'G') is stored, as follows:
          = 'U':  Upper triangle is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle is stored.

  TRANS   CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the form of op(W) to be used in the matrix
          multiplication, as follows:
          = 'N':  op(W) = W;
          = 'T':  op(W) = W';
          = 'C':  op(W) = W'.

  FLAG    CHARACTER*1
          Specifies which sign is used, as follows:
          = 'P':  The plus  sign is used;
          = 'M':  The minus sign is used.

  DEF     CHARACTER*1
          If FACT = 'N', specifies whether or not it is assumed that
          matrix R is positive definite, as follows:
          = 'D':  Matrix R is assumed positive definite;
          = 'I':  Matrix R is assumed indefinite.
          Both values can be used to perform the computations,
          irrespective to the R definiteness, but using the adequate
          value will save some computational effort (see FURTHER
          COMMENTS).

  IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (M)
          If FACT = 'C' or FACT = 'U', this array is not referenced.

  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 0 or LDWORK = -1, DWORK(1) returns the
          optimal value of LDWORK; if FACT = 'N' and LDWORK is set
          as specified below, DWORK(2) contains the reciprocal
          condition number of the given matrix R. DWORK(2) is set to
          zero if M = 0.
          On exit, if LDWORK = -2 on input or INFO = -26, then
          DWORK(1) returns the minimal value of LDWORK.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          The length of the array DWORK.

                                                      JOBL = 'Z';
          LDWORK &gt;= MAX(2,3*M,N*M) if FACT = 'N' and (JOBG = 'G' or
                                                      JOBL = 'N');

          For optimum performance LDWORK should be larger than 3*M,
          if FACT = 'N'.

          If LDWORK = -1, an optimal workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal size of the DWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
          array, and no error message is issued by XERBLA.

          If LDWORK = -2, a minimal workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the minimal size of the DWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
          array, and no error message is issued by XERBLA.

<PRE>
  Using argument TRANS allows to avoid the transposition of matrix A
  needed to solve optimal filtering/estimation problems by the same
  routines solving optimal control problems.
  If DEF is set to 'D', but R is indefinite, the computational
  effort for factorization will be approximately double, since
  Cholesky factorization, tried first, will fail, and symmetric
  indefinite factorization will then be used.
  If DEF is set to 'I', but R is positive definite, the
  computational effort will be slightly higher than that when using
  Cholesky factorization. It is recommended to use DEF = 'D' also if
  the definiteness is not known, but M is (much) smaller than N.
