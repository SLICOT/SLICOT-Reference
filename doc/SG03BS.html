  To compute the Cholesky factor U of the matrix X, X = U**H * U or
  X = U * U**H, which is the solution of the generalized d-stable
  discrete-time Lyapunov equation

      H            H                  2    H
     A  * X * A - E  * X * E = - SCALE  * B  * B,                (1)

  or the conjugate transposed equation

              H            H          2        H
     A * X * A  - E * X * E  = - SCALE  * B * B ,                (2)

  respectively, where A, E, B, and U are complex N-by-N matrices.
  The Cholesky factor U of the solution is computed without first
  finding X. The pencil A - lambda * E must be in complex
  generalized Schur form (A and E are upper triangular and the
  diagonal elements of E are non-negative real numbers). Moreover,
  it must be d-stable, i.e., the moduli of its eigenvalues must be
  less than one. B must be an upper triangular matrix with real
  non-negative entries on its main diagonal.

  The resulting matrix U is upper triangular. The entries on its
  main diagonal are non-negative. SCALE is an output scale factor
  set to avoid overflow in U.

<PRE>
  The method used by the routine is an extension of Hammarling's
  algorithm [1] to generalized Lyapunov equations. The real case is
  described in [2].

  We present the method for solving equation (1). Equation (2) can
  be treated in a similar fashion. For simplicity, assume SCALE = 1.

  Since all matrices A, E, B, and U are upper triangular, we use the
  following partitioning

            ( A11   A12 )        ( E11   E12 )
        A = (           ),   E = (           ),
            (   0   A22 )        (   0   E22 )

            ( B11   B12 )        ( U11   U12 )
        B = (           ),   U = (           ),                  (3)
            (   0   B22 )        (   0   U22 )

  where the size of the (1,1)-blocks is 1-by-1.

  We compute U11, U12**H and U22 in three steps.

  Step I:

     From (1) and (3) we get the 1-by-1 equation

           H     H                 H     H                  H
        A11 * U11 * U11 * A11 - E11 * U11 * U11 * E11 = -B11 * B11.

     For brevity, details are omitted here. The technique for
     computing U11 is similar to those applied to standard Lyapunov
     equations in Hammarling's algorithm ([1], section 5).

     Furthermore, the auxiliary scalars M1 and M2 defined as follows

        M1 = A11 / E11 ,   M2 = B11 / E11 / U11 ,

     are computed in a numerically reliable way.

  Step II:

     We solve for U12**H the linear system of equations, with
     scaling to prevent overflow,

                  H      H      H
        ( M1 * A22  - E22  ) U12  =

                    H              H           H
        = - M2 * B12  + U11 * ( E12  - M1 * A12  ) .

  Step III:

     One can show that

           H      H                  H      H
        A22  * U22  * U22 * A22 - E22  * U22  * U22 * E22  =

             H              H
        - B22  * B22 - y * y                                     (4)

     holds, where y is defined as follows

                 H           H      H      H
        y = ( B12   U11 * A12  + A22  * U12  ) * M3EV,

     where M3EV is a matrix which fulfils

             ( I - M2*M2     -M2*M1**H )              H
        M3 = (                         ) = M3EV * M3EV .
             (    -M1*M2  I - M1*M1**H )

     M3 is positive semidefinite and its rank is equal to 1.
     Therefore, a matrix M3EV can be found by solving the Hermitian
     eigenvalue problem for M3 such that y consists of one column.

     If B22_tilde is the square triangular matrix arising from the
     QR-factorization

            ( B22_tilde )     ( B22  )
        Q * (           )  =  (      ),
            (     0     )     ( y**H )

     then

             H              H                H
        - B22  * B22 - y * y   =  - B22_tilde  * B22_tilde.

     Replacing the right hand side in (4) by the term
     - B22_tilde**H * B22_tilde leads to a generalized Lyapunov
     equation like (1), but of dimension N-1.

  The solution U of the equation (1) can be obtained by recursive
  application of the steps I to III.

  The routine requires 2*N**3 flops. Note that we count a single
  floating point arithmetic operation as one flop.

  The Lyapunov equation may be very ill-conditioned. In particular,
  if the pencil A - lambda * E has a pair of almost reciprocal
  eigenvalues, then the Lyapunov equation will be ill-conditioned.
  Perturbed values were used to solve the equation.
  A condition estimate can be obtained from the routine SG03AD.
