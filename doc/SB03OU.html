<PRE>
  To solve for X = op(U)'*op(U) either the stable non-negative
  definite continuous-time Lyapunov equation
                                2
     op(A)'*X + X*op(A) = -scale *op(B)'*op(B)                   (1)

  or the convergent non-negative definite discrete-time Lyapunov
  equation
                                2
     op(A)'*X*op(A) - X = -scale *op(B)'*op(B)                   (2)

  where op(K) = K or K' (i.e., the transpose of the matrix K), A is
  an N-by-N matrix in real Schur form, op(B) is an M-by-N matrix,
  U is an upper triangular matrix containing the Cholesky factor of
  the solution matrix X, X = op(U)'*op(U), and scale is an output
  scale factor, set less than or equal to 1 to avoid overflow in X.
  If matrix B has full rank then the solution matrix X will be
  positive-definite and hence the Cholesky factor U will be
  nonsingular, but if B is rank deficient then X may only be
  positive semi-definite and U will be singular.

  In the case of equation (1) the matrix A must be stable (that
  is, all the eigenvalues of A must have negative real parts),
  and for equation (2) the matrix A must be convergent (that is,
  all the eigenvalues of A must lie inside the unit circle).

<B>Mode Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  DISCR   LOGICAL
          Specifies the type of Lyapunov equation to be solved as
          follows:
          = .TRUE. :  Equation (2), discrete-time case;
          = .FALSE.:  Equation (1), continuous-time case.

  LTRANS  LOGICAL
          Specifies the form of op(K) to be used, as follows:
          = .FALSE.:  op(K) = K    (No transpose);
          = .TRUE. :  op(K) = K**T (Transpose).

</PRE>
<B>Input/Output Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A and the number of columns in
          matrix op(B).  N &gt;= 0.

  M       (input) INTEGER
          The number of rows in matrix op(B).  M &gt;= 0.

  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The leading N-by-N upper Hessenberg part of this array
          must contain a real Schur form matrix S. The elements
          below the upper Hessenberg part of the array A are not
          referenced. The 2-by-2 blocks must only correspond to
          complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues (not to real
          eigenvalues).

  LDA     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array A.  LDA &gt;= MAX(1,N).

  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,N)
          if LTRANS = .FALSE., and dimension (LDB,M), if
          LTRANS = .TRUE..
          On entry, if LTRANS = .FALSE., the leading M-by-N part of
          this array must contain the coefficient matrix B of the
          equation.
          On entry, if LTRANS = .TRUE., the leading N-by-M part of
          this array must contain the coefficient matrix B of the
          equation.
          On exit, if LTRANS = .FALSE., the leading
          MIN(M,N)-by-MIN(M,N) upper triangular part of this array
          contains the upper triangular matrix R (as defined in
          METHOD), and the M-by-MIN(M,N) strictly lower triangular
          part together with the elements of the array TAU are
          overwritten by details of the matrix P (also defined in
          METHOD). When M &lt; N, columns (M+1),...,N of the array B
          are overwritten by the matrix Z (see METHOD).
          On exit, if LTRANS = .TRUE., the leading
          MIN(M,N)-by-MIN(M,N) upper triangular part of
          B(1:N,M-N+1), if M &gt;= N, or of B(N-M+1:N,1:M), if M &lt; N,
          contains the upper triangular matrix R (as defined in
          METHOD), and the remaining elements (below the diagonal
          of R) together with the elements of the array TAU are
          overwritten by details of the matrix P (also defined in
          METHOD). When M &lt; N, rows 1,...,(N-M) of the array B
          are overwritten by the matrix Z (see METHOD).

  LDB     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array B.
          LDB &gt;= MAX(1,M), if LTRANS = .FALSE.,
          LDB &gt;= MAX(1,N), if LTRANS = .TRUE..

  TAU     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension (MIN(N,M))
          This array contains the scalar factors of the elementary
          reflectors defining the matrix P.

  U       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension (LDU,N)
          The leading N-by-N upper triangular part of this array
          contains the Cholesky factor of the solution matrix X of
          the problem, X = op(U)'*op(U).
          The array U may be identified with B in the calling
          statement, if B is properly dimensioned, and the
          intermediate results returned in B are not needed.

  LDU     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array U.  LDU &gt;= MAX(1,N).

  SCALE   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
          The scale factor, scale, set less than or equal to 1 to
          prevent the solution overflowing.

</PRE>
<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 0, or INFO = 1, DWORK(1) returns the
          optimal value of LDWORK.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          The length of the array DWORK. LDWORK &gt;= MAX(1,4*N).
          For optimum performance LDWORK should sometimes be larger.

          If LDWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal size of the DWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
          array, and no error message related to LDWORK is issued by
          XERBLA.

</PRE>
<B>Error Indicator</B>
<PRE>
  INFO    INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit;

                value;
          = 1:  if the Lyapunov equation is (nearly) singular
                (warning indicator);
                if DISCR = .FALSE., this means that while the matrix
                A has computed eigenvalues with negative real parts,
                it is only just stable in the sense that small
                perturbations in A can make one or more of the
                eigenvalues have a non-negative real part;
                if DISCR = .TRUE., this means that while the matrix
                A has computed eigenvalues inside the unit circle,
                it is nevertheless only just convergent, in the
                sense that small perturbations in A can make one or
                more of the eigenvalues lie outside the unit circle;
                perturbed values were used to solve the equation
                (but the matrix A is unchanged);
          = 2:  if matrix A is not stable (that is, one or more of
                the eigenvalues of A has a non-negative real part),
                if DISCR = .FALSE., or not convergent (that is, one
                or more of the eigenvalues of A lies outside the
                unit circle), if DISCR = .TRUE.;
          = 3:  if matrix A has two or more consecutive non-zero
                elements on the first sub-diagonal, so that there is
                a block larger than 2-by-2 on the diagonal;
          = 4:  if matrix A has a 2-by-2 diagonal block with real
                eigenvalues instead of a complex conjugate pair.

<PRE>
  The method used by the routine is based on the Bartels and
  Stewart method [1], except that it finds the upper triangular
  matrix U directly without first finding X and without the need
  to form the normal matrix op(B)'*op(B) [2].

  If LTRANS = .FALSE., the matrix B is factored as

     B = P ( R ),  M &gt;= N,   B = P ( R  Z ),  M &lt; N,
           ( 0 )

  (QR factorization), where P is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix and
  R is a square upper triangular matrix.

  If LTRANS = .TRUE., the matrix B is factored as

     B = ( 0  R ) P,  M &gt;= N,  B = ( Z ) P,  M &lt; N,
                                   ( R )

  (RQ factorization), where P is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix and
  R is a square upper triangular matrix.

  These factorizations are used to solve the continuous-time
  Lyapunov equation in the canonical form
                                                     2
    op(A)'*op(U)'*op(U) + op(U)'*op(U)*op(A) = -scale *op(F)'*op(F),

  or the discrete-time Lyapunov equation in the canonical form
                                                     2
    op(A)'*op(U)'*op(U)*op(A) - op(U)'*op(U) = -scale *op(F)'*op(F),

  where U and F are N-by-N upper triangular matrices, and

     F = R,                                  if M &gt;= N, or

     F = ( R ),    if LTRANS = .FALSE.,  or
         ( 0 )

     F = ( 0  Z ), if LTRANS = .TRUE.,       if M &lt; N.
         ( 0  R )

  The canonical equation is solved for U.

  The Lyapunov equation may be very ill-conditioned. In particular,
  if A is only just stable (or convergent) then the Lyapunov
  equation will be ill-conditioned. "Large" elements in U relative
  to those of A and B, or a "small" value for scale, are symptoms
  of ill-conditioning. A condition estimate can be computed using
  SLICOT Library routine SB03MD.
