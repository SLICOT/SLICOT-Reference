<PRE>
  To find the line search parameter alpha minimizing the Frobenius
  norm (in a MATLAB-style notation)

     P(alpha) := norm(R(X+alpha*S), 'fro')
               = norm((1-alpha)*R(X) +/- alpha^2*V, 'fro'),

  where R(X) is the residual of a (generalized) continuous-time
  algebraic Riccati equation

     0 = op(A)'*X + X*op(A) +/- X*G*X + Q  =:  R(X),
  or
     0 = op(A)'*X*op(E) + op(E)'*X*op(A) +/- op(E)'*X*G*X*op(E) + Q
       =:  R(X),

  V = op(E)'*S*G*S*op(E), and op(W) is either W or W'. The matrix S
  is the Newton step.
                                                  _-1
  Instead of the symmetric N-by-N matrix G, G = B*R  *B', the N-by-M
                   -1
  matrix D, D = B*L  , such that G = D*D', may be given on entry.
             _  _
  The matrix R, R = L'*L, is a weighting matrix of the optimal
  problem, and L is its (Cholesky) factor.

  Optionally, V is specified as V = H*K, or V = F*F', but F or H and
  K must be evaluated in S. See the SLICOT Library routine SG02CW
  description for more details.

</PRE>
<B>Input/Output Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrices E, R, and S.  N &gt;= 0.

  M       (input) INTEGER
          If JOBG &lt;&gt; 'G', the number of columns of the matrices D,
          F, or K'.  M &gt;= 0.
          If JOBG = 'G', the value of M is meaningless.

  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDE,*)
          If JOBE = 'G' and (JOBG = 'G' or JOBG = 'D'), the leading
          N-by-N part of this array must contain the matrix E.
          If JOBE = 'I' or JOBG = 'F' or JOBG = 'H', this array is
          not referenced.

  LDE     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array E.
          LDE &gt;= MAX(1,N), if JOBE = 'G' and (JOBG = 'G' or
                                              JOBG = 'D');
          LDE &gt;= 1,        if JOBE = 'I'  or  JOBG = 'F' or

  R       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDR,N)
          The leading N-by-N upper or lower triangular part
          (depending on UPLO) of this array must contain the upper
          or lower triangular part, respectively, of the matrix
          R(X), the residual of the algebraic Riccati equation.
          The other strictly triangular part is not referenced.

  LDR     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array R.  LDR &gt;= MAX(1,N).

  S       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDS,*)
          If JOBG = 'G' or JOBG = 'D', the leading N-by-N part of
          this array must contain the symmetric Newton step
          matrix S. If JOBE = 'I', the full matrix must be given.
          Otherwise, it is sufficient to input only the triangular
          part specified by UPLO, and the remaining strictly
          triangular part is not referenced.
          If JOBG = 'F', this array is not referenced.
          If JOBG = 'H', the leading M-by-N part of this array must
          contain the matrix K.

  LDS     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array S.
          LDS &gt;= MAX(1,N), if JOBG =  'G' or JOBG =  'D';
          LDS &gt;= 1,        if JOBG =  'F';
          LDS &gt;= MAX(1,M), if JOBG =  'H'.

  G       (input/works.) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDG,*)
          If JOBG = 'G', the leading N-by-N upper or lower
          triangular part (depending on UPLO) of this array must
          contain the upper or lower triangular part, respectively,
          of the matrix G. The other strictly triangular part is not
          referenced. The diagonal elements of this array are
          modified internally, but are restored on exit.
          If JOBG = 'D', the leading N-by-M part of this array must
          contain the matrix D, so that G = D*D'.
          If JOBG = 'F', the leading N-by-M part of this array must
          contain the matrix F.
          If JOBG = 'H', leading N-by-M part of this array must
          contain the matrix H.

  LDG     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of array G.  LDG &gt;= MAX(1,N).

  ALPHA   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
          If INFO = 0, ALPHA contains the real number alpha which
          minimizes  P(alpha) = norm(R(X+alpha*S), 'fro') in the
          interval [0,2].
          If INFO = 1 or IWARN = 2, ALPHA is set equal to 1.

  RNORM   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
          On exit, if INFO &gt;= 0, RNORM contains the Frobenius norm
          of the residual R(X+alpha*S).

</PRE>
<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
          On exit, if LDWORK = -1 on input, then DWORK(1) returns
          the optimal value of LDWORK.
          On exit, if LDWORK = -2 on input or INFO = -19, then
          DWORK(1) returns the minimal value of LDWORK.
          On exit, if INFO = 0, the leading N-by-N upper or lower
          triangular part (depending on UPLO) of this array contains
          the corresponding triangular part of the matrix V.

  LDWORK  The length of the array DWORK.
          LDWORK &gt;= N*N + MAX( 2*N*N, 51 ),
                                    if JOBG = 'G' and JOBE = 'G';
          LDWORK &gt;= N*N + MAX( N*N, 51 ),
                                    if JOBG = 'G' and JOBE = 'I',
                                    or JOBG = 'F', or JOBG = 'H';
          LDWORK &gt;= N*N + MAX( MAX( N*N, 51 ), MIN( 2*N*N, N*M ) ),
                                    if JOBG = 'D' and JOBE = 'G';
          LDWORK &gt;= N*N + MAX( N*N, N*M, 51 ),
                                    if JOBG = 'D' and JOBE = 'I'.
          For M &lt;= N, the last two formulas simplify to
          LDWORK &gt;= N*N + MAX( N*N, 51).

          If LDWORK = -1, an optimal workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal size of the DWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
          array, and no error message is issued by XERBLA.

          If LDWORK = -2, a minimal workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the minimal size of the DWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
          array, and no error message is issued by XERBLA.

  IWARN   INTEGER
          = 0:  no warnings;

                was found; t = 1 was set.

  INFO    INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit;
          &lt; 0:  if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal
                value;
          = 1:  an error occurred during the call of the SLICOT
                Library routine MC01XD: the eigenvalues computation
                for the 3-by-3 (generalized) eigenproblem failed.

  The matrix V is computed with the suitable formula, and used to
  set up a third order polynomial whose roots in [0,2], if any, are
  candidates for the solution of the minimum residual problem.
  The roots of the polynomial are computed by solving an equivalent
  3-by-3 (generalized) eigenproblem.

  The calculations are backward stable. The computational effort is
  of the order of c*N**2*M operations. Here, M = N, if JOBG = 'G',
  and the coefficient c varies between 0.5 and 2.5, depending on
  JOBE and JOBG. (An "operation" includes a multiplication, an
  addition, and some address calculations.)
  The computed value of norm(R(X+alpha*S),'fro'), returned in RNORM,
  could be inaccurate if R(X) is small, since then subtraction
  cancellation could appear in the updating formula which is used.
  (This can happen, e.g., when solving a Riccati equation by
  Newton's method with line search, since then the sequence of R(.)
  tends to zero.) In such a case, it is better to recompute the
  residual from the data.

  The routine does not ckeck if the matrix S is zero, when a quick
  return with ALPHA = 1 is possible.
  With suitable input arguments E and G, this routine may also be
  used for discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations. (Matrix E
  must be the current closed-loop matrix.)
