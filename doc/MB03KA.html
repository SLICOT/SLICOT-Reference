<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Purpose</FONT></B>
<PRE>
  To reorder the diagonal blocks of the formal matrix product

     T22_K^S(K) * T22_K-1^S(K-1) * ... * T22_1^S(1),             (1)

  of length K, in the generalized periodic Schur form

           [  T11_k  T12_k  T13_k  ]
     T_k = [    0    T22_k  T23_k  ],    k = 1, ..., K,          (2)
           [    0      0    T33_k  ]

  where

  - the submatrices T11_k are NI(k+1)-by-NI(k), if S(k) = 1, or
    NI(k)-by-NI(k+1), if S(k) = -1, and contain dimension-induced
    infinite eigenvalues,
  - the submatrices T22_k are NC-by-NC and contain core eigenvalues,
    which are generically neither zero nor infinite,
  - the submatrices T33_k contain dimension-induced zero
    eigenvalues,

  such that the block with starting row index IFST in (1) is moved
  to row index ILST. The indices refer to the T22_k submatrices.

  Optionally, the transformation matrices Q_1,...,Q_K from the
  reduction into generalized periodic Schur form are updated with
  respect to the performed reordering.

<B>Mode Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  COMPQ   CHARACTER*1
          = 'N': do not compute any of the matrices Q_k;
          = 'U': each coefficient of Q must contain an orthogonal
                 matrix Q1_k on entry, and the products Q1_k*Q_k are
                 returned, where Q_k, k = 1, ..., K, performed the
                 reordering;
          = 'W': the computation of each Q_k is specified
                 individually in the array WHICHQ.

  WHICHQ  INTEGER array, dimension (K)
          If COMPQ = 'W', WHICHQ(k) specifies the computation of Q_k
          as follows:
          = 0:   do not compute Q_k;
          &gt; 0:   the kth coefficient of Q must contain an orthogonal
                 matrix Q1_k on entry, and the product Q1_k*Q_k is
                 returned.
          This array is not referenced if COMPQ &lt;&gt; 'W'.

  WS      LOGICAL
          = .FALSE. : do not perform the strong stability tests;
          = .TRUE.  : perform the strong stability tests; often,
                      this is not needed, and omitting them can save
                      some computations.

</PRE>
<B>Input/Output Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  K       (input) INTEGER
          The period of the periodic matrix sequences T and Q (the
          number of factors in the matrix product).  K &gt;= 2.
          (For K = 1, a standard eigenvalue reordering problem is
          obtained.)

  NC      (input) INTEGER
          The number of core eigenvalues.  0 &lt;= NC &lt;= min(N).

  KSCHUR  (input) INTEGER
          The index for which the matrix T22_kschur is upper quasi-
          triangular. All other T22 matrices are upper triangular.

  IFST    (input/output) INTEGER
  ILST    (input/output) INTEGER
          Specify the reordering of the diagonal blocks, as follows:
          The block with starting row index IFST in (1) is moved to
          row index ILST by a sequence of direct swaps between adjacent
          blocks in the product.
          On exit, if IFST pointed on entry to the second row of a
          2-by-2 block in the product, it is changed to point to the
          first row; ILST always points to the first row of the block
          in its final position in the product (which may differ from
          its input value by +1 or -1).
          1 &lt;= IFST &lt;= NC, 1 &lt;= ILST &lt;= NC.

  N       (input) INTEGER array, dimension (K)
          The leading K elements of this array must contain the
          dimensions of the factors of the formal matrix product T,
          such that the k-th coefficient T_k is an N(k+1)-by-N(k)
          matrix, if S(k) = 1, or an N(k)-by-N(k+1) matrix,
          if S(k) = -1, k = 1, ..., K, where N(K+1) = N(1).

  NI      (input) INTEGER array, dimension (K)
          The leading K elements of this array must contain the
          dimensions of the factors of the matrix sequence T11_k.
          N(k) &gt;= NI(k) + NC &gt;= 0.

  S       (input) INTEGER array, dimension (K)
          The leading K elements of this array must contain the
          signatures (exponents) of the factors in the K-periodic
          matrix sequence. Each entry in S must be either 1 or -1;
          the value S(k) = -1 corresponds to using the inverse of
          the factor T_k.

  T       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (*)
          On entry, this array must contain at position IXT(k) the
          matrix T_k, which is at least N(k+1)-by-N(k), if S(k) = 1,
          or at least N(k)-by-N(k+1), if S(k) = -1, in periodic
          Schur form.
          On exit, the matrices T_k are overwritten by the reordered
          periodic Schur form.

  LDT     INTEGER array, dimension (K)
          The leading dimensions of the matrices T_k in the one-
          dimensional array T.
          LDT(k) &gt;= max(1,N(k+1)),  if S(k) =  1,
          LDT(k) &gt;= max(1,N(k)),    if S(k) = -1.

  IXT     INTEGER array, dimension (K)
          Start indices of the matrices T_k in the one-dimensional
          array T.

  Q       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (*)
          On entry, this array must contain at position IXQ(k) a
          matrix Q_k of size at least N(k)-by-N(k), provided that
          COMPQ = 'U', or COMPQ = 'W' and WHICHQ(k) &gt; 0.
          On exit, if COMPQ = 'U', or COMPQ = 'W' and WHICHQ(k) &gt; 0,
          Q_k is post-multiplied with the orthogonal matrix that
          performed the reordering.
          This array is not referenced if COMPQ = 'N'.

  LDQ     INTEGER array, dimension (K)
          The leading dimensions of the matrices Q_k in the one-
          dimensional array Q.
          LDQ(k) &gt;= max(1,N(k)), if COMPQ = 'U', or COMPQ = 'W' and
                                                    WHICHQ(k) &gt; 0;
          This array is not referenced if COMPQ = 'N'.

  IXQ     INTEGER array, dimension (K)
          Start indices of the matrices Q_k in the one-dimensional
          array Q.
          This array is not referenced if COMPQ = 'N'.

</PRE>
<B>Tolerances</B>
<PRE>
  TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3)
          This array contains tolerance parameters. The weak and
          strong stability tests use a threshold computed by the
          formula  MAX( c*EPS*NRM, SMLNUM ),  where c is a constant,
          NRM is the Frobenius norm of the current matrix formed by
          concatenating K pairs of adjacent diagonal blocks of sizes
          1 and/or 2 in the T22_k submatrices from (2), which are
          swapped, and EPS and SMLNUM are the machine precision and
          safe minimum divided by EPS, respectively (see LAPACK
          Library routine DLAMCH). The norm NRM is computed by this
          routine; the other values are stored in the array TOL.
          TOL(1), TOL(2), and TOL(3) contain c, EPS, and SMLNUM,
          respectively. TOL(1) should normally be at least 10.

</PRE>
<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (4*K)

  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 0, DWORK(1) returns the optimal LDWORK.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          The dimension of the array DWORK.
          LDWORK &gt;= 10*K + MN, if all blocks between IFST and ILST
                               have order 1;
          LDWORK &gt;= 25*K + MN, if there is at least a block of
                               order 2, but no adjacent blocks of
                               order 2 can appear between IFST and
                               ILST during reordering;
          LDWORK &gt;= MAX(42*K + MN, 80*K - 48), if at least a pair of
                               adjacent blocks of order 2 can appear
                               between IFST and ILST during
                               reordering;
          where MN = MXN, if MXN &gt; 10, and MN = 0, otherwise, with
          MXN = MAX(N(k),k=1,...,K).

          If LDWORK = -1  a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal size of the DWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
          array, and no error message is issued by XERBLA.

</PRE>
<B>Error Indicator</B>
<PRE>
  INFO    INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit;
          &lt; 0:  if INFO = -21, the LDWORK argument was too small;
          = 1:  the reordering of T failed because some eigenvalues
                are too close to separate (the problem is very ill-
                conditioned); T may have been partially reordered.
                The returned value of ILST is the index where this
                was detected.
