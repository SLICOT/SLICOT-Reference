  To compute the Cholesky factor U of the matrix X,

              T
     X = op(U)  * op(U),

  which is the solution of either the generalized c-stable
  continuous-time Lyapunov equation

          T                    T
     op(A)  * X * op(E) + op(E)  * X * op(A)

              2        T
     = - SCALE  * op(B)  * op(B),                                (1)

  or the generalized d-stable discrete-time Lyapunov equation

          T                    T
     op(A)  * X * op(A) - op(E)  * X * op(E)

              2        T
     = - SCALE  * op(B)  * op(B),                                (2)

  without first finding X and without the need to form the matrix
  op(B)**T * op(B).

  op(K) is either K or K**T for K = A, B, E, U. A and E are N-by-N
  matrices, op(B) is an M-by-N matrix. The resulting matrix U is an
  N-by-N upper triangular matrix with non-negative entries on its
  main diagonal. SCALE is an output scale factor set to avoid
  overflow in U.

  In the continuous-time case (1) the pencil A - lambda * E must be
  c-stable (that is, all eigenvalues must have negative real parts).
  In the discrete-time case (2) the pencil A - lambda * E must be
  d-stable (that is, the moduli of all eigenvalues must be smaller
  than one).

</PRE>
<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 0, DWORK(1) returns the optimal value
          of LDWORK.
          On exit, if INFO = -21, DWORK(1) returns the minimum value
          of LDWORK.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          The dimension of the array DWORK.

          LDWORK &gt;= MAX(1,2*N,6*N-6),  if FACT = 'F'.
          For good performance, LDWORK should be larger.

          If LDWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal size of the DWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
          array, and no error message related to LDWORK is issued by
          XERBLA.

<PRE>
  An extension [2] of Hammarling's method [1] to generalized
  Lyapunov equations is utilized to solve (1) or (2).

  First the pencil A - lambda * E is reduced to real generalized
  Schur form A_s - lambda * E_s by means of orthogonal
  transformations (QZ-algorithm):

     A_s = Q**T * A * Z   (upper quasitriangular),               (3)

     E_s = Q**T * E * Z   (upper triangular).                    (4)

  If the pencil A - lambda * E has already been factorized prior to
  calling the routine, however, then the factors A_s, E_s, Q and Z
  may be supplied and the initial factorization omitted.

  Depending on the parameters TRANS and M, the N-by-N upper
  triangular matrix B_s is defined as follows. In any case Q_B is
  an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, which need not be accumulated.

  1. If TRANS = 'N' and M &lt; N, B_s is the upper triangular matrix
     from the QR-factorization

        ( Q_B  O )           ( B * Z )
        (        ) * B_s  =  (       ),
        (  O   I )           (   O   )

     where the O's are zero matrices of proper size and I is the
     identity matrix of order N-M.

  2. If TRANS = 'N' and M &gt;= N, B_s is the upper triangular matrix
     from the (rectangular) QR-factorization

              ( B_s )
        Q_B * (     )  =  B * Z,
              (  O  )

     where O is the (M-N)-by-N zero matrix.

  3. If TRANS = 'T' and M &lt; N, B_s is the upper triangular matrix
     from the RQ-factorization

                    ( Q_B  O )
        (B_s  O ) * (        )  =  ( Q**T * B   O ).
                    (  O   I )

  4. If TRANS = 'T' and M &gt;= N, B_s is the upper triangular matrix
     from the (rectangular) RQ-factorization

        ( B_s   O ) * Q_B  =  Q**T * B,

     where O is the N-by-(M-N) zero matrix.

  Assuming SCALE = 1, the transformation of A, E and B described
  above leads to the reduced continuous-time equation

              T        T
       op(A_s)  op(U_s)  op(U_s) op(E_s)

              T        T
     + op(E_s)  op(U_s)  op(U_s) op(A_s)

                 T
     =  - op(B_s)  op(B_s)                                       (5)

  or to the reduced discrete-time equation

              T        T
       op(A_s)  op(U_s)  op(U_s) op(A_s)

              T        T
     - op(E_s)  op(U_s)  op(U_s) op(E_s)

                 T
     =  - op(B_s)  op(B_s).                                      (6)

  For brevity we restrict ourself to equation (5) and the case
  TRANS = 'N'. The other three cases can be treated in a similar
  fashion.

  We use the following partitioning for the matrices A_s, E_s, B_s,
  and U_s

              ( A11   A12 )          ( E11   E12 )
        A_s = (           ),   E_s = (           ),
              (   0   A22 )          (   0   E22 )

              ( B11   B12 )          ( U11   U12 )
        B_s = (           ),   U_s = (           ).              (7)
              (   0   B22 )          (   0   U22 )

  The size of the (1,1)-blocks is 1-by-1 (iff A_s(2,1) = 0.0) or
  2-by-2.

  We compute U11, U12**T, and U22 in three steps.

  Step I:

     From (5) and (7) we get the 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 equation

             T      T                   T      T
          A11  * U11  * U11 * E11  + E11  * U11  * U11 * A11

                 T
          = - B11  * B11.

     For brevity, details are omitted here. See [2]. The technique
     for computing U11 is similar to those applied to standard
     Lyapunov equations in Hammarling's algorithm ([1], section 6).

     Furthermore, the auxiliary matrices M1 and M2 defined as
     follows

                            -1      -1
        M1 = U11 * A11 * E11   * U11

                      -1      -1
        M2 = B11 * E11   * U11

     are computed in a numerically reliable way.

  Step II:

     The generalized Sylvester equation

           T      T      T      T
        A22  * U12  + E22  * U12  * M1  =

             T           T      T      T      T
        - B12  * M2 - A12  * U11  - E12  * U11  * M1

     is solved for U12**T.

  Step III:

     It can be shown that

           T      T                  T      T
        A22  * U22  * U22 * E22 + E22  * U22  * U22 * A22  =

             T              T
        - B22  * B22 - y * y                                     (8)

     holds, where y is defined as

               T        T      T      T      T       T
        y = B12  - ( E12  * U11  + E22  * U12  ) * M2 .

     If B22_tilde is the square triangular matrix arising from the
     (rectangular) QR-factorization

                    ( B22_tilde )     ( B22  )
        Q_B_tilde * (           )  =  (      ),
                    (     O     )     ( y**T )

     where Q_B_tilde is an orthogonal matrix of order N, then

             T              T                T
        - B22  * B22 - y * y   =  - B22_tilde  * B22_tilde.

     Replacing the right hand side in (8) by the term
     - B22_tilde**T * B22_tilde leads to a reduced generalized
     Lyapunov equation of lower dimension compared to (5).

  The recursive application of the steps I to III yields the
  solution U_s of the equation (5).

  It remains to compute the solution matrix U of the original
  problem (1) or (2) from the matrix U_s. To this end we transform
  the solution back (with respect to the transformation that led
  from (1) to (5) (from (2) to (6)) and apply the QR-factorization
  (RQ-factorization). The upper triangular solution matrix U is
  obtained by

     Q_U * U  =  U_s * Q**T     (if TRANS = 'N'),

  or

     U * Q_U  =  Z * U_s        (if TRANS = 'T'),

  where Q_U is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. Again, the orthogonal
  matrix Q_U need not be accumulated.

  The Lyapunov equation may be very ill-conditioned. In particular,
  if DICO = 'D' and the pencil A - lambda * E has a pair of almost
  reciprocal eigenvalues, or DICO = 'C' and the pencil has an almost
  degenerate pair of eigenvalues, then the Lyapunov equation will be
  ill-conditioned. Perturbed values were used to solve the equation.
  A condition estimate can be obtained from the routine SG03AD.
  When setting the error indicator INFO, the routine does not test
  for near instability in the equation but only for exact
  instability.
