  To solve for X either the generalized continuous-time Lyapunov
  equation

          T                T
     op(A)  X op(E) + op(E)  X op(A) = SCALE * Y,                (1)

  or the generalized discrete-time Lyapunov equation

          T                T
     op(A)  X op(A) - op(E)  X op(E) = SCALE * Y,                (2)

  where op(M) is either M or M**T for M = A, E and the right hand
  side Y is symmetric. A, E, Y, and the solution X are N-by-N
  matrices. SCALE is an output scale factor, set to avoid overflow
  in X.

  Estimates of the separation and the relative forward error norm

          of LDWORK.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          The length of the array DWORK. The following table
          contains the minimal work space requirements depending
          on the choice of JOB and FACT.

                 JOB        FACT    |  LDWORK
                 -------------------+-------------------
                 'X'        'F'     |  MAX(1,N)
                 'X'        'N'     |  MAX(1,4*N)
                 'B', 'S'   'F'     |  MAX(1,2*N**2)
                 'B', 'S'   'N'     |  MAX(1,2*N**2,4*N)

          For optimum performance, LDWORK should be larger.

          If LDWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal size of the DWORK
          array, returns this value as the first entry of the DWORK
          array, and no error message related to LDWORK is issued by
          XERBLA.

                lambda_j are eigenvalues of A - lambda * E. Hence,
                equation (2) is singular;  perturbed values were

                degenerate pair of eigenvalues. That is, lambda_i =

                lambda_j are eigenvalues of A - lambda * E. Hence,
                equation (1) is singular;  perturbed values were
                used to solve the equation (but the matrices A and
                E are unchanged).

<PRE>
  A straightforward generalization [3] of the method proposed by
  Bartels and Stewart [1] is utilized to solve (1) or (2).

  First the pencil A - lambda * E is reduced to real generalized
  Schur form A_s - lambda * E_s by means of orthogonal
  transformations (QZ-algorithm):

     A_s = Q**T * A * Z   (upper quasitriangular)                (3)

     E_s = Q**T * E * Z   (upper triangular).                    (4)

  If FACT = 'F', this step is omitted. Assuming SCALE = 1 and
  defining

           ( Z**T * Y * Z   :   TRANS = 'N'
     Y_s = &lt;
           ( Q**T * Y * Q   :   TRANS = 'T'

           ( Q**T * X * Q    if TRANS = 'N'
     X_s = &lt;                                                     (5)
           ( Z**T * X * Z    if TRANS = 'T'

  leads to the reduced Lyapunov equation

            T                      T
     op(A_s)  X_s op(E_s) + op(E_s)  X_s op(A_s) = Y_s,          (6)

  or
            T                      T
     op(A_s)  X_s op(A_s) - op(E_s)  X_s op(E_s) = Y_s,          (7)

  which are equivalent to (1) or (2), respectively. The solution X_s
  of (6) or (7) is computed via block back substitution (if TRANS =
  'N') or block forward substitution (if TRANS = 'T'), where the
  block order is at most 2. (See [1] and [3] for details.)
  Equation (5) yields the solution matrix X.

  For fast computation the estimates of the separation and the
  forward error are gained from (6) or (7) rather than (1) or
  (2), respectively. We consider (6) and (7) as special cases of the
  generalized Sylvester equation

     R * X * S + U * X * V = Y,                                  (8)

  whose separation is defined as follows

     sep = sep(R,S,U,V) =   min   || R * X * S + U * X * V || .
                         ||X|| = 1                           F
                              F

  Equation (8) is equivalent to the system of linear equations

     K * vec(X) = (kron(S**T,R) + kron(V**T,U)) * vec(X) = vec(Y),

  where kron is the Kronecker product of two matrices and vec
  is the mapping that stacks the columns of a matrix. If K is
  nonsingular then

     sep = 1 / ||K**(-1)|| .
                          2

  We estimate ||K**(-1)|| by a method devised by Higham [2]. Note
  that this method yields an estimation for the 1-norm but we use it
  as an approximation for the 2-norm. Estimates for the forward
  error norm are provided by

     FERR = 2 * EPS * ||A_s||  * ||E_s||  / sep
                             F          F

  in the continuous-time case (1) and

     FERR = EPS * ( ||A_s|| **2 + ||E_s|| **2 ) / sep
                           F             F

  in the discrete-time case (2).
  The reciprocal condition number, RCOND, of the Lyapunov equation
  can be estimated by FERR/EPS.

  The number of flops required by the routine is given by the
  following table. Note that we count a single floating point
  arithmetic operation as one flop. c is an integer number of modest
  size (say 4 or 5).

                |  FACT = 'F'            FACT = 'N'
     -----------+------------------------------------------
     JOB = 'B'  |  (26+8*c)/3 * N**3     (224+8*c)/3 * N**3
     JOB = 'S'  |  8*c/3 * N**3          (198+8*c)/3 * N**3
     JOB = 'X'  |  26/3 * N**3           224/3 * N**3

  The algorithm is backward stable if the eigenvalues of the pencil
  A - lambda * E are real. Otherwise, linear systems of order at
  most 4 are involved into the computation. These systems are solved
  by Gauss elimination with complete pivoting. The loss of stability
  of the Gauss elimination with complete pivoting is rarely
  encountered in practice.

  The Lyapunov equation may be very ill-conditioned. In particular,
  if DICO = 'D' and the pencil A - lambda * E has a pair of almost
  reciprocal eigenvalues, or DICO = 'C' and the pencil has an almost
  degenerate pair of eigenvalues, then the Lyapunov equation will be
  ill-conditioned. Perturbed values were used to solve the equation.
  Ill-conditioning can be detected by a very small value of the
  reciprocal condition number RCOND.
