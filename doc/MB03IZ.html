<PRE>
  To move the eigenvalues with strictly negative real parts of an
  N-by-N complex skew-Hamiltonian/Hamiltonian pencil aS - bH in
  structured Schur form, with

                             (  0  I  )
    S = J Z' J' Z, where J = (        ),
                             ( -I  0  )

  to the leading principal subpencil, while keeping the triangular
  form. On entry, we have

        (  A  D  )      (  B  F  )
    Z = (        ), H = (        ),
        (  0  C  )      (  0 -B' )

  where A and B are upper triangular and C is lower triangular.
  Z and H are transformed by a unitary symplectic matrix U and a
  unitary matrix Q such that

                    (  Aout  Dout  )
    Zout = U' Z Q = (              ), and
                    (    0   Cout  )
                                                                 (1)
                         (  Bout  Fout  )
    Hout = J Q' J' H Q = (              ), 
                         (    0  -Bout' )

  where Aout, Bout and Cout remain in triangular form. The notation
  M' denotes the conjugate transpose of the matrix M.
  Optionally, if COMPQ = 'I' or COMPQ = 'U', the unitary matrix Q
  that fulfills (1) is computed.
  Optionally, if COMPU = 'I' or COMPU = 'U', the unitary symplectic
  matrix 

        (  U1  U2  )
    U = (          )
        ( -U2  U1  )   

  that fulfills (1) is computed.

                  matrix, and the unitary matrix Q is returned;

                  entry, and the matrix Q0*Q is returned, where Q
                  is the product of the unitary transformations

                  submatrices of a unitary symplectic matrix U0
                  on entry, and the updated submatrices U1 and U2
                  of the matrix product U0*U are returned, where U
                  is the product of the unitary symplectic
                  transformations that are applied to the pencil
                  aS - bH to reorder the eigenvalues.

  The algorithm reorders the eigenvalues like the following scheme:
                                                     
  Step 1: Reorder the eigenvalues in the subpencil aC'*A - bB.
       I. Reorder the eigenvalues with negative real parts to the
          top.
      II. Reorder the eigenvalues with positive real parts to the
          bottom.

  Step 2: Reorder the remaining eigenvalues with negative real
          parts.
       I. Exchange the eigenvalues between the last diagonal block
          in aC'*A - bB and the last diagonal block in aS - bH.
      II. Move the eigenvalues in the N/2-th place to the (MM+1)-th
          place, where MM denotes the current number of eigenvalues
          with negative real parts in aC'*A - bB.

  The algorithm uses a sequence of unitary transformations as
  described on page 38 in [1]. To achieve those transformations the
  elementary SLICOT Library subroutines MB03CZ and MB03GZ are called
  for the corresponding matrix structures.
