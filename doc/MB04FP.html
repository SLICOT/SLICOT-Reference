<PRE>
  To compute the eigenvalues of a real N-by-N skew-Hamiltonian/
  skew-Hamiltonian pencil aS - bT with

        (  A  D  )         (  B  F  )
    S = (        ) and T = (        ).                           (1)
        (  E  A' )         (  G  B' )

  Optionally, if JOB = 'T', the pencil aS - bT will be transformed
  to the structured Schur form: an orthogonal transformation matrix
  Q is computed such that

                  (  Aout  Dout  )
    J Q' J' S Q = (              ), and
                  (   0    Aout' )
                                                                 (2)
                  (  Bout  Fout  )            (  0  I  )
    J Q' J' T Q = (              ), where J = (        ),
                  (   0    Bout' )            ( -I  0  )

  Aout is upper triangular, and Bout is upper quasi-triangular. The
  notation M' denotes the transpose of the matrix M.
  Optionally, if COMPQ = 'I' or COMPQ = 'U', the orthogonal
  transformation matrix Q will be computed.

<B>Mode Parameters</B>
<PRE>
  JOB     CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the computation to be performed, as follows:
          = 'E':  compute the eigenvalues only; S and T will not
                  necessarily be put into skew-Hamiltonian
                  triangular form (2);
          = 'T':  put S and T into skew-Hamiltonian triangular form
                  (2), and return the eigenvalues in ALPHAR, ALPHAI
                  and BETA.

  COMPQ   CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether to compute the orthogonal transformation
          matrix Q as follows:
          = 'N':  Q is not computed;
          = 'I':  the array Q is initialized internally to the unit
                  matrix, and the orthogonal matrix Q is returned;
          = 'U':  the array Q contains an orthogonal matrix Q0 on
                  entry, and the product Q0*Q is returned, where Q
                  is the product of the orthogonal transformations
                  that are applied to the pencil aS - bT to reduce
                  S and T to the forms in (2), for COMPQ = 'I'.

          part of this array must contain the strictly lower

          of this array contains the strictly upper triangular part

          On exit, if JOB = 'T', the leading N/2-by-N/2 part of this
          array contains the matrix Bout; otherwise, it contains

          2-by-2 blocks, which are correctly set.

  LDB     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= MAX(1, N/2).

  FG      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
                         (LDFG, N/2+1)
          On entry, the leading N/2-by-N/2 strictly lower triangular
          part of this array must contain the strictly lower

          N/2-by-N/2 strictly upper triangular part of the submatrix
          in the columns 2 to N/2+1 of this array must contain the
          strictly upper triangular part of the skew-symmetric
          matrix F.
          The entries on the diagonal and the first superdiagonal of
          this array are not referenced, but are assumed to be zero.
          On exit, if JOB = 'T', the leading N/2-by-N/2 strictly
          upper triangular part of the submatrix in the columns
          2 to N/2+1 of this array contains the strictly upper
          triangular part of the skew-symmetric matrix Fout.
          If JOB = 'E', the leading N/2-by-N/2 strictly upper
          triangular part of the submatrix in the columns 2 to N/2+1
          of this array contains the strictly upper triangular part
          of the skew-symmetric matrix F just before the application
          of the QZ algorithm. The remaining entries are
          meaningless.

  LDFG    INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array FG.
          LDFG &gt;= MAX(1, N/2).

  Q       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ, N)
          On entry, if COMPQ = 'U', then the leading N-by-N part of
          this array must contain a given matrix Q0, and on exit,
          the leading N-by-N part of this array contains the product
          of the input matrix Q0 and the transformation matrix Q
          used to transform the matrices S and T.
          On exit, if COMPQ = 'I', then the leading N-by-N part of
          this array contains the orthogonal transformation matrix
          Q.
          If COMPQ = 'N', this array is not referenced.

  LDQ     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Q.
          LDQ &gt;= 1,         if COMPQ = 'N';

  ALPHAR  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N/2)
          The real parts of each scalar alpha defining an eigenvalue
          of the pencil aS - bT.

  ALPHAI  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N/2)
          The imaginary parts of each scalar alpha defining an
          eigenvalue of the pencil aS - bT.
          If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then the j-th eigenvalue is real; if
          positive, then the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues are a
          complex conjugate pair.

  BETA    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N/2)
          The scalars beta that define the eigenvalues of the pencil
          aS - bT.
          Together, the quantities alpha = (ALPHAR(j),ALPHAI(j)) and
          beta = BETA(j) represent the j-th eigenvalue of the pencil
          aS - bT, in the form lambda = alpha/beta. Since lambda may
          overflow, the ratios should not, in general, be computed.
          Due to the skew-Hamiltonian/skew-Hamiltonian structure of
          the pencil, every eigenvalue occurs twice and thus it has
          only to be saved once in ALPHAR, ALPHAI and BETA.

</PRE>
<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (N/2+1)
          On exit, IWORK(1) contains the number of (pairs of)
          possibly inaccurate eigenvalues, q &lt;= N/2, and the
          nonzero absolute values in IWORK(2), ..., IWORK(N/2+1) are
          indices of the possibly inaccurate eigenvalues, as well as
          of the corresponding 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 diagonal blocks in
          the arrays A and B on exit. The 2-by-2 blocks correspond
          to negative values in IWORK. One negative value is stored
          for each such eigenvalue pair. Its modulus indicates the
          starting index of a 2-by-2 block.

  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 0, DWORK(1) returns the optimal LDWORK;
          DWORK(2) and DWORK(3) contain the Frobenius norms of the
          matrices S and T on entry. These norms are used in the
          tests to decide that some eigenvalues are considered as
          unreliable.
          On exit, if INFO = -19, DWORK(1) returns the minimum
          value of LDWORK.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          The dimension of the array DWORK.
          LDWORK &gt;= MAX(3,N/2,2*N-6),  if JOB = 'E' and COMPQ = 'N';
          LDWORK &gt;= MAX(3,N**2/4+N/2), if JOB = 'T' and COMPQ = 'N';
          LDWORK &gt;= MAX(1,3*N**2/4),   if               COMPQ&lt;&gt; 'N'.
          For good performance LDWORK should generally be larger.

          If LDWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed;
          the routine only calculates the optimal size of the
          DWORK array, returns this value as the first entry of
          the DWORK array, and no error message related to LDWORK
          is issued by XERBLA.

<B>Error Indicator</B>

  INFO    INTEGER
          = 0: succesful exit;
          &lt; 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value;
          = 1: QZ iteration failed in the LAPACK Library routine
               DHGEQZ. (QZ iteration did not converge or computation
               of the shifts failed.)
          = 2: warning: the pencil is numerically singular.

<A name="Method"><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Method</FONT></B></A>
<PRE>
  The algorithm uses Givens rotations and Householder reflections to
  annihilate elements in S and T such that S is in skew-Hamiltonian
  triangular form and T is in skew-Hamiltonian Hessenberg form:

      (  A1  D1  )      (  B1  F1  )
  S = (          ), T = (          ),
      (   0  A1' )      (   0  B1' )

  where A1 is upper triangular and B1 is upper Hessenberg.
  Subsequently, the QZ algorithm is applied to the pencil aA1 - bB1
  to determine orthogonal matrices Q1 and Q2 such that
  Q2' A1 Q1 is upper triangular and Q2' B1 Q1 is upper quasi-
  triangular.

  For large values of N, the routine applies the transformations
  for reducing T on panels of columns. The user may specify in INFO
  the desired number of columns. If on entry INFO &lt;= 0, then the
  routine estimates a suitable value of this number.
