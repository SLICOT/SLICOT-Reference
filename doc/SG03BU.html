<PRE>
  To compute the Cholesky factor U of the matrix X, X = U**T * U or
  X = U * U**T, which is the solution of the generalized d-stable
  discrete-time Lyapunov equation

      T            T                  2    T
     A  * X * A - E  * X * E = - SCALE  * B  * B,                (1)

  or the transposed equation

              T            T          2        T
     A * X * A  - E * X * E  = - SCALE  * B * B ,                (2)

  respectively, where A, E, B, and U are real N-by-N matrices. The
  Cholesky factor U of the solution is computed without first
  finding X. The pencil A - lambda * E must be in generalized Schur
  form ( A upper quasitriangular, E upper triangular ). Moreover, it
  must be d-stable, i.e. the moduli of its eigenvalues must be less
  than one. B must be an upper triangular matrix with non-negative
  entries on its main diagonal.

  The resulting matrix U is upper triangular. The entries on its
  main diagonal are non-negative. SCALE is an output scale factor
  set to avoid overflow in U.

<PRE>
  The method [2] used by the routine is an extension of Hammarling's
  algorithm [1] to generalized Lyapunov equations.

  We present the method for solving equation (1). Equation (2) can
  be treated in a similar fashion. For simplicity, assume SCALE = 1.

  The matrix A is an upper quasitriangular matrix, i.e. it is a
  block triangular matrix with square blocks on the main diagonal
  and the block order at most 2. We use the following partitioning
  for the matrices A, E, B and the solution matrix U

            ( A11   A12 )        ( E11   E12 )
        A = (           ),   E = (           ),
            (   0   A22 )        (   0   E22 )

            ( B11   B12 )        ( U11   U12 )
        B = (           ),   U = (           ).                  (3)
            (   0   B22 )        (   0   U22 )

  The size of the (1,1)-blocks is 1-by-1 (iff A(2,1) = 0.0) or
  2-by-2.

  We compute U11 and U12**T in three steps.

  Step I:

     From (1) and (3) we get the 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 equation

             T      T                   T      T
          A11  * U11  * U11 * A11  - E11  * U11  * U11 * E11

                 T
          = - B11  * B11.

     For brevity, details are omitted here. The technique for
     computing U11 is similar to those applied to standard Lyapunov
     equations in Hammarling's algorithm ([1], section 6).

     Furthermore, the auxiliary matrices M1 and M2 defined as
     follows

                            -1      -1
        M1 = U11 * A11 * E11   * U11

                      -1      -1
        M2 = B11 * E11   * U11

     are computed in a numerically reliable way.

  Step II:

     We solve for U12**T the generalized Sylvester equation

           T      T           T      T
        A22  * U12  * M1 - E22  * U12

               T           T      T      T      T
        = - B12  * M2 + E12  * U11  - A12  * U11  * M1.

  Step III:

     One can show that

           T      T                  T      T
        A22  * U22  * U22 * A22 - E22  * U22  * U22 * E22  =

             T              T
        - B22  * B22 - y * y                                     (4)

     holds, where y is defined as follows

               T      T      T      T
        w = A12  * U11  + A22  * U12

                 T
        y = ( B12   w ) * M3EV,

     where M3EV is a matrix which fulfils

             ( I-M2*M2**T   -M2*M1**T )              T
        M3 = (                        ) = M3EV * M3EV .
             (  -M1*M2**T  I-M1*M1**T )

     M3 is positive semidefinite and its rank is equal to the size
     of U11. Therefore, a matrix M3EV can be found by solving the
     symmetric eigenvalue problem for M3 such that y consists of
     either 1 or 2 rows.

     If B22_tilde is the square triangular matrix arising from the
     QR-factorization

            ( B22_tilde )     ( B22  )
        Q * (           )  =  (      ),
            (     0     )     ( y**T )

     then

             T              T                T
        - B22  * B22 - y * y   =  - B22_tilde  * B22_tilde.

     Replacing the right hand side in (4) by the term
     - B22_tilde**T * B22_tilde leads to a generalized Lyapunov
     equation of lower dimension compared to (1).

  The solution U of the equation (1) can be obtained by recursive
  application of the steps I to III.

  The routine requires 2*N**3 flops. Note that we count a single
  floating point arithmetic operation as one flop.

  The Lyapunov equation may be very ill-conditioned. In particular,
  if the pencil A - lambda * E has a pair of almost reciprocal
  eigenvalues, then the Lyapunov equation will be ill-conditioned.
  Perturbed values were used to solve the equation.
  A condition estimate can be obtained from the routine SG03AD.
  When setting the error indicator INFO, the routine does not test
  for near instability in the equation but only for exact
  instability.
