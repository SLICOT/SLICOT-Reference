<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Purpose</FONT></B>
<PRE>
  To construct a state-space representation (A,BS,CS,DS) of the
  projection of V*G or conj(V)*G containing the poles of G, from the
  state-space representations (A,B,C,D) and (AV-lambda*EV,BV,CV,DV),
  of the transfer-function matrices G and V, respectively.
  G is assumed to be a stable transfer-function matrix and
  the state matrix A must be in a real Schur form.
  When computing the stable projection of V*G, it is assumed
  that G and V have completely distinct poles.
  When computing the stable projection of conj(V)*G, it is assumed
  that G and conj(V) have completely distinct poles.

  Note: For a transfer-function matrix G, conj(G) denotes the
  conjugate of G given by G'(-s) for a continuous-time system or
  G'(1/z) for a discrete-time system.

  If JOB = 'V', the matrices of the stable projection of V*G are
  computed as

    BS = B,  CS = CV*X + DV*C,  DS = DV*D,

  where X satisfies the generalized Sylvester equation

    AV*X - EV*X*A + BV*C = 0.

  If JOB = 'C', the matrices of the stable projection of conj(V)*G
  are computed using the following formulas:

  - for a continuous-time system, the matrices BS, CS and DS of
    the stable projection are computed as

      BS = B,  CS = BV'*X + DV'*C,  DS = DV'*D,

    where X satisfies the generalized Sylvester equation

      AV'*X + EV'*X*A + CV'*C = 0.

  - for a discrete-time system, the matrices BS, CS and DS of
    the stable projection are computed as

      BS = B,  CS = BV'*X*A + DV'*C,  DS = DV'*D + BV'*X*B,

    where X satisfies the generalized Sylvester equation

      EV'*X - AV'*X*A = CV'*C.
